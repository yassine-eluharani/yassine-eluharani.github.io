You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations\n            for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That way,\n            Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the\n            cluster. Amazon Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster\n            becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new\n            writer.

CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure that popular\n            content can be served quickly to your viewers. Amazon CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring\n            more of your content closer to your viewers, even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP,\n            to help improve performance for that content.</p>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront offers an origin failover feature to help support your data resiliency needs. Amazon\n            CloudFront is a global service that delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called\n            edge locations or points of presence (POPs). If your content is not already cached in an edge location,\n            Amazon CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've identified as the source for the definitive\n            version of the content.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Shield</strong> - AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection\n            service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on detection and automatic\n            inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency. There are two tiers of AWS Shield -\n            Standard and Advanced. AWS Shield cannot be used to improve application resiliency to handle spikes in\n            traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Global Accelerator</strong> - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the\n            availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP\n            addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions,\n            such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon Global\n            Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as\n            well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional\n            failover. Since Amazon CloudFront is better for improving application resiliency to handle spikes in\n            traffic, so this option is ruled out.</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Direct Connect</strong> - AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network\n            connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.

Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s\n            globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3\n            over an optimized network path.</p>\n<p>Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion\n            of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of\n            any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object\n            are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. If you're uploading large objects over\n            a stable high-bandwidth network, use multipart uploading to maximize the use of your available bandwidth by\n            uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance. If you're uploading over a spotty\n            network, use multipart uploading to increase resiliency to network errors by avoiding upload restarts.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Upload the compressed file in a single operation</strong> - In general, when your object size\n            reaches 100 megabytes, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a\n            single operation. Multipart upload provides improved throughput - you can upload parts in parallel to\n            improve throughput. Therefore, this option is not correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Upload the compressed file using multipart upload</strong> - Although using multipart upload would\n            certainly speed up the process, combining with Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) would further\n            improve the transfer speed. Therefore just using multipart upload is not the correct option.</p>\n<p><strong>FTP the compressed file into an Amazon EC2 instance that runs in the same region as the Amazon S3\n              bucket. Then transfer the file from the Amazon EC2 instance into the Amazon S3 bucket</strong> - This is a\n            roundabout process of getting the file into Amazon S3 and added as a distractor. Although it is technically\n            feasible to follow this process, it would involve a lot of scripting and certainly would not be the fastest\n            way to get the file into Amazon S3.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

It is used for workloads such as machine learning, high-performance computing\n            (HPC), video processing, and financial modeling. The open-source Lustre file system is designed for\n            applications that require fast storage – where you want your storage to keep up with your compute. FSx for\n            Lustre integrates with Amazon S3, making it easy to process data sets with the Lustre file system. When\n            linked to an S3 bucket, an FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files and allows\n            you to write changed data back to S3.</p>\n<p>FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed fashion as\n            well as easily store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3. Therefore this option is the BEST fit for the given\n            problem statement.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</strong> - Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully\n            managed, highly reliable file storage that is accessible over the industry-standard Service Message Block\n            (SMB) protocol. It is built on Windows Server, delivering a wide range of administrative features such as\n            user quotas, end-user file restore, and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) integration.\n            FSx for Windows does not allow you to present S3 objects as files and does not allow you to write changed\n            data back to S3. Therefore you cannot reference the \"cold data\" with quick access for reads and updates at\n            low cost. Hence this option is not correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong> - Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for processing\n            vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink,\n            Apache Hudi, and Presto. Amazon EMR uses Hadoop, an open-source framework, to distribute your data and\n            processing across a resizable cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.\n            EMR does not offer the same storage and processing speed as FSx for Lustre. So it is not the right fit for\n            the given high-performance workflow scenario.</p>\n<p><strong>AWS Glue</strong> - AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that\n            makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue job is meant to be used\n            for batch ETL data processing.\n            AWS Glue does not offer the same storage and processing speed as FSx for Lustre.

Global Accelerator is a good fit for\n            non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that\n            specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon CloudFront</strong> - Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service\n            that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high\n            transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.</p>\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its\n            edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images\n            and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery), while Global\n            Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP.</p>\n<p><strong>AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</strong> - Both of the services, ELB and Global Accelerator solve\n            the challenge of routing user requests to healthy application endpoints. AWS Global Accelerator relies on\n            ELB to provide the traditional load balancing features such as support for internal and non-AWS endpoints,\n            pre-warming, and Layer 7 routing. However, while ELB provides load balancing within one Region, AWS Global\n            Accelerator provides traffic management across multiple Regions.</p>\n<p>A regional ELB load balancer is an ideal target for AWS Global Accelerator. By using a regional ELB load\n            balancer, you can precisely distribute incoming application traffic across backends, such as Amazon EC2\n            instances or Amazon ECS tasks, within an AWS Region.</p>\n<p>If you have workloads that cater to a global client base, AWS recommends that you use AWS Global\n            Accelerator. If you have workloads hosted in a single AWS Region and used by clients in and around the same\n            Region, you can use an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer to manage your resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Route 53</strong> - Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name\n            System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and\n            cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com\n            into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.

Unlike Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose,\n            KDS does not offer a ready-made integration via an intermediary AWS Lambda function to reliably dump data\n            into Amazon S3. You will need to do a lot of custom coding to get the AWS Lambda function to process the\n            incoming stream and then store the transformed output to Amazon S3 with the constraint that the buffer is\n            maintained reliably and no transformed data is lost.

For example, you might want all queries\n            from Europe to be routed to an ELB load balancer in the Frankfurt region.

When a user\n            requests your content, Amazon CloudFront typically serves the requested content regardless of where the user\n            is located. If you need to prevent users in specific countries from accessing your content, you can use the\n            CloudFront geo restriction feature to do one of the following:\n            Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one of the countries on a whitelist of approved\n            countries.\n            Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned\n            countries.

To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS\n            Regions. When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain (example.com or\n            acme.example.com), it determines which AWS Regions you've created latency records for, determines which\n            region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Route 53\n            responds with the value from the selected record, such as the IP address for a web server.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Route 53 based weighted routing policy to restrict distribution of content to only the\n              locations in which you have distribution rights</strong> - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple\n            resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much\n            traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing\n            and testing new versions of the software.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Route 53 based failover routing policy to restrict distribution of content to only the\n              locations in which you have distribution rights</strong> - Failover routing lets you route traffic to a\n            resource when the resource is healthy or to a different resource when the first resource is unhealthy. The\n            primary and secondary records can route traffic to anything from an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a\n            website to a complex tree of records.</p>\n<p>Weighted routing or failover routing or latency routing cannot be used to restrict the distribution of\n            content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights.

Use AWS WAF to block or allow requests\n            based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses. You can also use AWS WAF preconfigured\n            protections to block common attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.</p>\n<p><strong>Configure AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) on the Application Load Balancer in a Amazon\n              Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</strong></p>\n<p>You can use AWS WAF with your Application Load Balancer to allow or block requests based on the rules in a\n            web access control list (web ACL). Geographic (Geo) Match Conditions in AWS WAF allows you to use AWS WAF to\n            restrict application access based on the geographic location of your viewers. With geo match conditions you\n            can choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access.</p>\n<p>Geo match conditions are important for many customers. For example, legal and licensing requirements\n            restrict some customers from delivering their applications outside certain countries. These customers can\n            configure a whitelist that allows only viewers in those countries. Other customers need to prevent the\n            downloading of their encrypted software by users in certain countries. These customers can configure a\n            blacklist so that end-users from those countries are blocked from downloading their software.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront in a Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon\n              VPC)</strong> - Geo Restriction feature of Amazon CloudFront helps in restricting traffic based on the\n            user's geographic location. But, CloudFront works from edge locations and doesn't belong to a VPC. Hence,\n            this option itself is incorrect and given only as a distractor.</p>\n<p><strong>Configure the security group on the Application Load Balancer</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Configure the security group for the Amazon EC2 instances</strong></p>\n<p>Security Groups cannot restrict access based on the user's geographic location.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/aws-waf-now-supports-geographic-match/\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/aws-waf-now-supports-geographic-match/</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-web-application-firewall-waf-for-application-load-balancers/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-web-application-firewall-waf-for-application-load-balancers/</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/12/AWS-WAF-now-available-on-Application-Load-Balancer/\">https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/12/AWS-WAF-now-available-on-Application-Load-Balancer/</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

It provides ordering of\n            records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis\n            Applications. The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records for a given partition key to the\n            same record processor, making it easier to build multiple applications reading from the same Amazon Kinesis\n            data stream (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering).</p>\n<p>AWS recommends Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for use cases with requirements that are similar to the\n            following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Routing related records to the same record processor (as in streaming MapReduce). For example, counting\n              and aggregation are simpler when all records for a given key are routed to the same record processor.</li>\n<li>Ordering of records. For example, you want to transfer log data from the application host to the\n              processing/archival host while maintaining the order of log statements.</li>\n<li>Ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently. For example, you have one\n              application that updates a real-time dashboard and another that archives data to Amazon Redshift. You want\n              both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.</li>\n<li>Ability to consume records in the same order a few hours later. For example, you have a billing\n              application and an audit application that runs a few hours behind the billing application. Because Amazon\n              Kinesis Data Streams stores data for up to 365 days, you can run the audit application up to 365 days\n              behind the billing application.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</strong> - Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a\n            highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple\n            microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SNS provides topics for\n            high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. Amazon SNS is a notification service and cannot be used\n            for real-time processing of data.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</strong> - Amazon\n            Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for storing messages as\n            they travel between computers. Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distributed application\n            components and helps you build applications in which messages are processed independently (with\n            message-level ack/fail semantics), such as automated workflows. Since multiple applications need to consume\n            the same data stream concurrently, Kinesis is a better choice when compared to the combination of SQS with\n            SNS.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)</strong> - As\n            discussed above, Amazon Kinesis is a better option for this use case in comparison to Amazon SQS. Also,\n            Amazon SES does not fit this use-case. Hence, this option is an incorrect answer.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/faqs/</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
