A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource,\n            defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a\n            request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are\n            stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based\n            policies, permissions boundaries, Organizations service control policy (SCPs), access control lists (ACLs),\n            and session policies.</p>\n<p>Consider the following snippet from the given policy document:</p>\n<pre><code> \"Condition\": {\n              \"IpAddress\": {\n              \"aws:SourceIp\": \"34.50.31.0/24\"\n              }\n              }\n            </code></pre>\n<p>The <code>aws:SourceIP</code> in this condition always represents the IP of the caller of the API. That is\n            very helpful if you want to restrict access to certain AWS API for example from the public IP of your\n            on-premises infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Please see this overview of Elastic vs Public vs Private IP addresses:</p>\n<p>elastic IP address (EIP) - An elastic IP address (EIP) is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud\n            computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account. With an Elastic IP address, you can\n            mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your\n            account.</p>\n<p>Private IP address - A private IPv4 address is an IP address that's not reachable over the Internet. You\n            can use private IPv4 addresses for communication between instances in the same VPC.</p>\n<p>Public IP address - A public IP address is an IPv4 address that's reachable from the Internet. You can use\n            public addresses for communication between your instances and the Internet.</p>\n<p>Please note <code>34.50.31.0/24</code> is a public IP range, not a private IP range. Private IP ranges are:\n            192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (65,536 IP addresses)\n            172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (1,048,576 IP addresses)\n            10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (16,777,216 IP addresses)</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>It allows starting an Amazon EC2 instance only when they have a Public IP within the\n              <code>34.50.31.0/24</code> CIDR block</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It allows starting an Amazon EC2 instance only when they have an Elastic IP within the\n              <code>34.50.31.0/24</code> CIDR block</strong></p>\n<p><strong>It allows starting an Amazon EC2 instance only when they have a Private IP within the\n              <code>34.50.31.0/24</code> CIDR block</strong></p>\n<p>Each of these three options suggests that the IP addresses of the Amazon EC2 instances must belong to the\n            <code>34.50.31.0/24</code> CIDR block for the EC2 instances to start. Actually, the policy states that the\n            AMazon EC2 instance should start only when the IP where the call originates is within the\n            <code>34.50.31.0/24</code> CIDR block.

VPCs have been\n            provisioned into multiple AWS accounts, perhaps to facilitate network isolation or to enable delegated\n            network administration. When deploying distributed architectures such as this, a popular approach is to\n            build a \"shared services VPC, which provides access to services required by workloads in each of the VPCs.\n            This might include directory services or VPC endpoints. Sharing resources from a central location instead of\n            building them in each VPC may reduce administrative overhead and cost.</p>\n<p>Centralized VPC Endpoints (multiple VPCs):\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q21-i1.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/</a>\n</p>\n<p>A VPC endpoint allows you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services without requiring an\n            Internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Endpoints are virtual\n            devices that are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow\n            communication between instances in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth\n            constraints on your network traffic.</p>\n<p>VPC endpoints enable you to reduce data transfer charges resulting from network communication between\n            private VPC resources (such as Amazon Elastic Cloud Computeâ€”or EC2â€”instances) and AWS Services (such as\n            Amazon Quantum Ledger Database, or QLDB). Without VPC endpoints configured, communications that originate\n            from within a VPC destined for public AWS services must egress AWS to the public Internet in order to access\n            AWS services. This network path incurs outbound data transfer charges. Data transfer charges for traffic\n            egressing from Amazon EC2 to the Internet vary based on volume. With VPC endpoints configured, communication\n            between your VPC and the associated AWS service does not leave the Amazon network. If your workload requires\n            you to transfer significant volumes of data between your VPC and AWS, you can reduce costs by leveraging VPC\n            endpoints.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Transit VPC to reduce cost and share the resources across Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon\n              VPCs)</strong> - Transit VPC uses customer-managed Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) VPN instances\n            in a dedicated transit VPC with an Internet gateway. This design requires the customer to deploy, configure,\n            and manage EC2-based VPN appliances, which will result in additional EC2, and potentially third-party\n            product and licensing charges. Note that this design will generate additional data transfer charges for\n            traffic traversing the transit VPC: data is charged when it is sent from a spoke VPC to the transit VPC, and\n            again from the transit VPC to the on-premises network or a different AWS Region.

This design\n            connects multiple VPCs in a fully meshed configuration, with peering connections between each pair of VPCs.\n            With this configuration, each VPC has access to the resources in all other VPCs. Each peering connection\n            requires modifications to all the other VPCsâ€™ route tables and, as the number of VPCs grows, this can be\n            difficult to maintain. And keep in mind that AWS recommends a maximum of 125 peering connections per VPC.\n            It's complex to manage and isn't a right fit for the current scenario.</p>\n<p>More on Fully meshed VPC Peers:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q21-i3.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf\">https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Single_Region_Multi_VPC_Connectivity.pdf</a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Use VPCs connected with AWS Direct Connect</strong> - This approach is a good alternative for\n            customers who need to connect a high number of VPCs to a central VPC or on-premises resources, or who\n            already have an AWS Direct Connect connection in place. This design also offers customers the ability to\n            incorporate transitive routing into their network design. For example, if VPC A and VPC B are both connected\n            to an on-premises network using AWS Direct Connect connections, then the two VPCs can be connected to each\n            other via AWS Direct Connect.

You can leverage Amazon Cognito User Pools to either\n            provide built-in user management or integrate with external identity providers, such as Facebook, Twitter,\n            Google+, and Amazon. Whether your users sign-in directly or through a third party, all members of the user\n            pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).</p>\n<p>User pools provide:\n            1. Sign-up and sign-in services.\n            2. A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users.\n            3. Social sign-in with Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple, as well as sign-in with\n            SAML identity providers from your user pool.\n            4. User directory management and user profiles.\n            5. Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account\n            takeover protection, and phone and email verification.\n            6. Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.</p>\n<p>After creating an Amazon Cognito user pool, in API Gateway, you must then create a COGNITO_USER_POOLS\n            authorizer that uses the user pool.</p>\n<p>Amazon Cognito User Pools:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q24-i1.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS_IAM authorization</strong> - For consumers who currently are located within your AWS\n            environment or have the means to retrieve AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) temporary credentials to\n            access your environment, you can use AWS_IAM authorization and add least-privileged permissions to the\n            respective IAM role to securely invoke your API. API Gateway API Keys is not a security mechanism and should\n            not be used for authorization unless itâ€™s a public API. It should be used primarily to track a consumerâ€™s\n            usage across your API.</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Lambda authorizer for Amazon API Gateway</strong> - If you have an existing Identity\n            Provider (IdP), you can use an AWS Lambda authorizer for Amazon API Gateway to invoke a Lambda function to\n            authenticate/validate a given user against your Identity Provider. You can use a Lambda authorizer for\n            custom validation logic based on identity metadata.</p>\n<p>A Lambda authorizer can send additional information derived from a bearer token or request context values\n            to your backend service. For example, the authorizer can return a map containing user IDs, user names, and\n            scope. By using Lambda authorizers, your backend does not need to map authorization tokens to user-centric\n            data, allowing you to limit the exposure of such information to just the authorization function.</p>\n<p>When using Lambda authorizers, AWS strictly advises against passing credentials or any sort of sensitive\n            data via query string parameters or headers, so this is not as secure as using Amazon Cognito User Pools.\n          </p>\n<p>In addition, both these options do not offer built-in user management.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Cognito Identity Pools</strong> - The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user\n            pools and identity pools. Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS\n            services. To enable users in your user pool to access AWS resources, you can configure an identity pool to\n            exchange user pool tokens for AWS credentials. So, identity pools aren't an authentication mechanism in\n            themselves and hence aren't a choice for this use case.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enable-cognito-user-pool.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enable-cognito-user-pool.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused Amazon\n            EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a\n            Spot Instance is called a Spot price. Only spot fleets can maintain target capacity by launching replacement\n            instances after Spot Instances in the fleet are terminated, so spot instances, by themselves, are not the\n            right fit for this use-case.</p>\n<p><strong>Run the workload on Reserved Instances (RI)</strong> - Reserved Instances are less cost-optimized\n            than Spot Instances, and most efficient when used continuously. Here the workload is once a month, so this\n            is not efficient.</p>\n<p><strong>Run the workload on Dedicated Hosts</strong> - Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your\n            eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the\n            flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and\n            elasticity of AWS. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you\n            can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not particularly cost-efficient.

An Aurora cluster volume is a virtual database storage volume that spans multiple\n            Availability Zones (AZs), with each Availability Zone (AZ) having a copy of the DB cluster data. Two types\n            of DB instances make up an Aurora DB cluster:</p>\n<p>Primary DB instance â€“ Supports read and write operations, and performs all of the data modifications to the\n            cluster volume. Each Aurora DB cluster has one primary DB instance.</p>\n<p>Aurora Replica â€“ Connects to the same storage volume as the primary DB instance and supports only read\n            operations. Each Aurora DB cluster can have up to 15 Aurora Replicas in addition to the primary DB instance.\n            Aurora automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica in case the primary DB instance becomes unavailable.\n            You can specify the failover priority for Aurora Replicas. Aurora Replicas can also offload read workloads\n            from the primary DB instance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/images/AuroraArch001.png\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>Aurora Replicas have two main purposes. You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations for your\n            application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That way, Aurora can\n            spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. Aurora\n            Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora\n            automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer.</p>\n<p>While setting up a Multi-AZ deployment for Aurora, you create an Aurora replica or reader node in a\n            different Availability Zone (AZ).</p>\n<p>Multi-AZ for Aurora:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q13-i1.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n<p>You use the reader endpoint for read-only connections for your Aurora cluster. This endpoint uses a\n            load-balancing mechanism to help your cluster handle a query-intensive workload. The reader endpoint is the\n            endpoint that you supply to applications that do reporting or other read-only operations on the cluster. The\n            reader endpoint load-balances connections to available Aurora Replicas in an Aurora DB cluster.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q13-i2.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Overview.Endpoints.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Provision another Amazon Aurora database and link it to the primary database as a read\n              replica</strong> - You cannot provision another Aurora database and then link it as a read-replica for the\n            primary database.

Aurora backups are continuous and incremental so you can quickly restore to any point\n            within the backup retention period. No performance impact or interruption of database service occurs as\n            backup data is being written.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q52-i1.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>Automated backups occur daily during the preferred backup window. If the backup requires more time than\n            allotted to the backup window, the backup continues after the window ends, until it finishes. The backup\n            window can't overlap with the weekly maintenance window for the DB cluster. Aurora backups are continuous\n            and incremental, but the backup window is used to create a daily system backup that is preserved within the\n            backup retention period. The latest restorable time for a DB cluster is the most recent point at which you\n            can restore your DB cluster, typically within 5 minutes of the current time.</p>\n<p>For the given use case, you can create the dev database by restoring from the automated backups of Amazon\n            Aurora.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Leverage Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas and restore the dev database via\n              mysqldump</strong> - Restoring the dev database via mysqldump would still result in a significant load on\n            the primary DB, so this option fails to address the given requirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Leverage Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and use the standby instance as the dev\n              database</strong> - The standby is there just for handling failover in a Multi-AZ deployment. You cannot\n            access the standby instance and use it as a dev database. Hence this option is incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Leverage Amazon RDS for SQL server with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas. Use the read\n              replica as the dev database</strong> - Amazon RDS supports Multi-AZ deployments for Microsoft SQL Server\n            by using either SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM) or Always On Availability Groups (AGs). Amazon RDS\n            monitors and maintains the health of your Multi-AZ deployment.</p>\n<p>Multi-AZ deployments provide increased availability, data durability, and fault tolerance for DB instances.\n            In the event of planned database maintenance or unplanned service disruption, Amazon RDS automatically fails\n            over to the up-to-date secondary DB instance. For SQL Server, I/O activity is suspended briefly during\n            backup for Multi-AZ deployments.</p>\n<p>A read replica is only meant to serve read traffic. The primary purpose of the read replica is to replicate\n            the data in the primary DB instance. A read replica cannot be used as a dev database because it does not\n            allow any database write operations.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Backups.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.ReadReplicas.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.ReadReplicas.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

This type of deployment allows you to test features in the green environment\n            without impacting the currently running version of your application. When youâ€™re satisfied that the green\n            version is working properly, you can gradually reroute the traffic from the old blue environment to the new\n            green environment. Blue/green deployments can mitigate common risks associated with deploying software, such\n            as downtime and rollback capability.</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute a portion of traffic to a particular deployment</strong>\n</p>\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS\n            global network, this improves the availability and performance of your internet applications. It provides\n            two static anycast IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or\n            multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Elastic IP addresses\n            or Amazon EC2 instances, in a single or in multiple AWS regions.</p>\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator uses endpoint weights to determine the proportion of traffic that is directed to\n            endpoints in an endpoint group, and traffic dials to control the percentage of traffic that is directed to\n            an endpoint group (an AWS region where your application is deployed).</p>\n<p>While relying on the DNS service is a great option for blue/green deployments, it may not fit use-cases\n            that require a fast and controlled transition of the traffic. Some client devices and internet resolvers\n            cache DNS answers for long periods; this DNS feature improves the efficiency of the DNS service as it\n            reduces the DNS traffic across the Internet, and serves as a resiliency technique by preventing\n            authoritative name-server overloads. The downside of this in blue/green deployments is that you donâ€™t know\n            how long it will take before all of your users receive updated IP addresses when you update a record, change\n            your routing preference or when there is an application failure.</p>\n<p>With AWS Global Accelerator, you can shift traffic gradually or all at once between the blue and the green\n            environment and vice-versa without being subject to DNS caching on client devices and internet resolvers,\n            traffic dials and endpoint weights changes are effective within seconds.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Route 53 weighted routing to spread traffic across different deployments</strong> -\n            Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or subdomain\n            name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a\n            variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of the software. As discussed\n            earlier, DNS caching is a negative behavior for this use case and hence Amazon Route 53 is not a good\n            option.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic across deployments</strong> - Elastic Load\n            Balancing (ELB) can distribute traffic across healthy instances. You can also use the Application Load\n            Balancers weighted target groups feature for blue/green deployments as it does not rely on the DNS service.\n            In addition you donâ€™t need to create new ALBs for the green environment. As the use-case refers to a global\n            application, so this option cannot be used for a multi-Region solution which is needed for the given\n            requirement.</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS CodeDeploy deployment options to choose the right deployment</strong> - In AWS CodeDeploy,\n            a deployment is the process, and the components involved in the process, of installing content on one or\n            more instances. This content can consist of code, web and configuration files, executables, packages,\n            scripts, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy deploys content that is stored in a source repository, according to the\n            configuration rules you specify. Blue/Green deployment is one of the deployment types that CodeDeploy\n            supports. CodeDeploy is not meant to distribute traffic across instances, so this option is incorrect.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deployments\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deployments</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming\n            administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. RDS allows you to\n            create, read, update, and delete records without any item lock or ambiguity. All RDS transactions must be\n            ACID compliant or be Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable to ensure data integrity.</p>\n<p>Atomicity requires that either transaction as a whole is successfully executed or if a part of the\n            transaction fails, then the entire transaction be invalidated. Consistency mandates the data written to the\n            database as part of the transaction must adhere to all defined rules, and restrictions including\n            constraints, cascades, and triggers. Isolation is critical to achieving concurrency control and makes sure\n            each transaction is independent unto itself. Durability requires that all of the changes made to the\n            database be permanent once a transaction is completed.\n            Hence, the best fit is Amazon RDS.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon ElastiCache</strong> - Amazon ElastiCache allows you to seamlessly set up, run, and scale\n            popular open-source compatible in-memory data stores in the cloud. Build data-intensive apps or boost the\n            performance of your existing databases by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory\n            data stores. Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores,\n            Gaming, Geospatial Services, Real-Time Analytics, and Queuing. ElastiCache could work but it's a better fit\n            as a caching technology to enhance reads.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</strong> - This option is incorrect as Amazon S3 is not a\n            database technology that supports queries on database tables out of the box. It is an object storage service\n            that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Your applications\n            can easily achieve thousands of transactions per second in request performance when uploading and retrieving\n            storage from Amazon S3.</p>\n<p>After a successful write of a new object or an overwrite of an existing object, any subsequent read request\n            immediately receives the latest version of the object. Amazon S3 also provides strong consistency for list\n            operations, so after a write, you can immediately perform a listing of the objects in a bucket with any\n            changes reflected. Strong read-after-write consistency helps when you need to immediately read an object\n            after a write. For example, strong read-after-write consistency when you often read and list immediately\n            after writing objects.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Neptune</strong> - Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service\n            that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of\n            Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of\n            relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency.</p>\n<p>Amazon Neptune is highly available, with read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon\n            S3, and replication across Availability Zones.

Use latency\n            based routing when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the region\n            that provides the lowest latency. To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your\n            resources in multiple AWS Regions. When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain\n            (example.com or acme.example.com), it determines which AWS Regions you've created latency records for,\n            determines which region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that\n            region.

So this option is incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>AWS CloudHSM</strong> - AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables\n            you to easily generate and use your encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. With AWS CloudHSM, you can manage your\n            encryption keys using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs. AWS CloudHSM is standards-compliant and enables you\n            to export all of your keys to most other commercially-available HSMs, subject to your configurations. It is\n            a fully-managed service that automates time-consuming administrative tasks for you, such as hardware\n            provisioning, software patching, high-availability, and backups.</p>\n<p>AWS CloudHSM is also an encryption service, not a secrets store. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store</strong> - AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (aka SSM\n            Parameter Store) provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets\n            management. You can store data such as passwords, database strings, Amazon EC2 instance IDs, Amazon Machine\n            Image (AMI) IDs, and license codes as parameter values. You can store values as plain text or encrypted\n            data. You can reference Systems Manager parameters in your scripts, commands, SSM documents, and\n            configuration and automation workflows by using the unique name that you specified when you created the\n            parameter.</p>\n<p>AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store can serve as a secrets store, but you must rotate the secrets yourself,\n            it doesn't have an automatic capability for this. So this option is incorrect.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/\">https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/\">https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/the-right-way-to-store-secrets-using-parameter-store/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/the-right-way-to-store-secrets-using-parameter-store/</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
