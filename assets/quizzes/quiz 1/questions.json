You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent\n                        instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create\n                        a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cluster placement group\n </p>\n <p>\n  Partition placement group\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spread placement group.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A Spread placement group is a group of instances that are each placed on distinct racks, with\n                        each rack having its own network and power source.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical\n                        instances that should be kept separate from each other. Launching instances in a spread\n                        placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share\n                        the same racks.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. You can have\n                        a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group. Therefore, to deploy 15\n                        EC2 instances in a single Spread placement group, the company needs to use 3 AZs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spread placement group overview:\n  <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt5-q11-i1.jpg\" style=\"display: none;\"/>\n  <span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\">\n   <div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\">\n    <img alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt5-q11-i1.jpg\"/>\n    <button class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-large ud-btn-link ud-heading-md open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\" type=\"button\">\n     <svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\" focusable=\"false\" role=\"img\">\n      <use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\">\n      </use>\n     </svg>\n    </button>\n   </div>\n  </span>\n  via -\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   7\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   14\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   15\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  These three options contradict the details provided in the explanation above, so these options\n                        are incorrect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reference:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"

A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or\n                    resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or\n                    role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or\n                    denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies:\n                    identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations SCPs,\n                    ACLs, and session policies.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Implementing an IAM policy to forbid users would be disruptive and wouldn't go unnoticed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use S3 access logs to analyze user access using Athena\n  </strong>\n  - Amazon S3 server access\n                    logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. Server access logs are\n                    useful for many applications. For example, access log information can be useful in security and\n                    access audits. It can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3\n                    bill. AWS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for\n                    your Amazon S3 resources, as it provides more options to store, analyze and act on the log\n                    information.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Implement a bucket policy requiring MFA for all operations\n  </strong>\n  - Amazon S3 supports\n                    MFA-protected API access, a feature that can enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to\n                    your Amazon S3 resources. Multi-factor authentication provides an extra level of security that you\n                    can apply to your AWS environment. It is a security feature that requires users to prove the\n                    physical possession of an MFA device by providing a valid MFA code. Changing the bucket policy to\n                    require MFA would not go unnoticed.\n </p>\n <p>\n  References:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/logging-with-S3.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/logging-with-S3.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-7\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-7\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"

When linked to an S3 bucket, an FSx for Lustre file system transparently\n                    presents S3 objects as files and allows you to write changed data back to S3.\n </p>\n <p>\n  FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed\n                    fashion as well as easily store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3.

Therefore you cannot reference the \"cold data\" with quick access for reads\n                    and updates at low cost. Hence this option is not correct.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Amazon EMR\n  </strong>\n  - Amazon EMR is the industry-leading cloud big data platform for\n                    processing vast amounts of data using open source tools such as Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache\n                    HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto.

You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent\n                    instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create a\n                    placement group using one of the following placement strategies:\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cluster – packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables\n                    workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node\n                    communication that is typical of HPC applications.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Partition – spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one\n                    partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions.\n                    This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop,\n                    Cassandra, and Kafka.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Spread – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce\n                    correlated failures.\n </p>\n <p>\n  There is no charge for creating a placement group.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use a Cluster placement group\n  </strong>\n  - A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of\n                    instances within a single Availability Zone. A cluster placement group can span peered VPCs in the\n                    same Region. Instances in the same cluster placement group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit\n                    of up to 10 Gbps for TCP/IP traffic and are placed in the same high-bisection bandwidth segment of\n                    the network.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency,\n                    high network throughput, or both. They are also recommended when the majority of the network traffic\n                    is between the instances in the group. To provide the lowest latency and the highest\n                    packet-per-second network performance for your placement group, choose an instance type that\n                    supports enhanced networking.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Image of Cluster placement group:\n  <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q20-i1.jpg\" style=\"display: none;\"/>\n  <span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\">\n   <div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\">\n    <img alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q20-i1.jpg\"/>\n    <button class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-large ud-btn-link ud-heading-md open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\" type=\"button\">\n     <svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\" focusable=\"false\" role=\"img\">\n      <use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\">\n      </use>\n     </svg>\n    </button>\n   </div>\n  </span>\n  via -\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Image of Partition placement group:\n  <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q20-i2.jpg\" style=\"display: none;\"/>\n  <span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\">\n   <div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\">\n    <img alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q20-i2.jpg\"/>\n    <button class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-large ud-btn-link ud-heading-md open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\" type=\"button\">\n     <svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\" focusable=\"false\" role=\"img\">\n      <use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\">\n      </use>\n     </svg>\n    </button>\n   </div>\n  </span>\n  via -\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Image of Spread placement group:\n  <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q20-i3.jpg\" style=\"display: none;\"/>\n  <span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\">\n   <div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\">\n    <img alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q20-i3.jpg\"/>\n    <button class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-large ud-btn-link ud-heading-md open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\" type=\"button\">\n     <svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\" focusable=\"false\" role=\"img\">\n      <use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\">\n      </use>\n     </svg>\n    </button>\n   </div>\n  </span>\n  via -\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use Spot Instances\n  </strong>\n  - A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available\n                    for less than the On-Demand price.

It also contains agents you approve for logging, security, performance monitoring, etc.\n                    For the given use-case, you can have the static installation components already setup via the golden\n                    AMI.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use EC2 user data to customize the dynamic installation parts at boot time\n  </strong>\n  - EC2\n                    instance user data is the data that you specified in the form of a configuration script while\n                    launching your instance. You can use EC2 user data to customize the dynamic installation parts at\n                    boot time, rather than installing the application itself at boot time.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Store the installation files in S3 so they can be quickly retrieved\n  </strong>\n  - Amazon S3\n                    bucket can be used as a storage location for your source code, logs, and other artifacts that are\n                    created when you use Elastic Beanstalk.

VPC endpoints for Amazon SQS are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a highly\n                    available, scalable technology that enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS\n                    services.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Amazon VPC endpoints are easy to configure. They also provide reliable connectivity to Amazon SQS\n                    without requiring an internet gateway, Network Address Translation (NAT) instance, VPN connection,\n                    or AWS Direct Connect connection. With VPC endpoints, the data between your Amazon VPC and Amazon\n                    SQS queue is transferred within the Amazon network, helping protect your instances from internet\n                    traffic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating\n                    the exposure of data to the public Internet. AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between\n                    VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications, securely on the Amazon network. AWS PrivateLink\n                    makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify the\n                    network architecture.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use Internet Gateway to access Amazon SQS\n  </strong>\n  - An internet gateway is a horizontally\n                    scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in\n                    your VPC and the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on\n                    your network traffic. This option is ruled out as the team does not want to use the public internet\n                    to access Amazon SQS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use VPN connection to access Amazon SQS\n  </strong>\n  - AWS Site-to-Site VPN (aka VPN\n                    Connection) enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your\n                    Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office\n                    network to the cloud with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to\n                    establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN\n                    Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have\n                    low to modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based\n                    connectivity.

You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations\n                    for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That\n                    way, Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have\n                    in the cluster. Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a\n                    cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its\n                    place as the new writer. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones\n                    that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use CloudFront distribution in front of the Application Load Balancer\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data,\n                    videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all\n                    within a developer-friendly environment. CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make\n                    sure that popular content can be served quickly to your viewers. CloudFront also has regional edge\n                    caches that bring more of your content closer to your viewers, even when the content is not popular\n                    enough to stay at a POP, to help improve performance for that content.\n </p>\n <p>\n  CloudFront offers an origin failover feature to help support your data resiliency needs. CloudFront\n                    is a global service that delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called\n                    edge locations or points of presence (POPs). If your content is not already cached in an edge\n                    location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you've identified as the source for the\n                    definitive version of the content.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <em>\n   * Use AWS Shield\n  </em>\n  * - AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)\n                    protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. AWS Shield provides always-on\n                    detection and automatic inline mitigations that minimize application downtime and latency. There are\n                    two tiers of AWS Shield - Standard and Advanced. Shield cannot be used to improve application\n                    resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use AWS Global Accelerator\n  </strong>\n  - AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the\n                    availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP\n                    addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS\n                    Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances.\n                    Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice\n                    over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or\n                    deterministic, fast regional failover. Since CloudFront is better for improving application\n                    resiliency to handle spikes in traffic, so this option is ruled out.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use AWS Direct Connect\n  </strong>\n  - AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network\n                    connection between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations. Using industry-standard\n                    802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces. AWS\n                    Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network\n                    connections between your intranet and Amazon VPC. Direct Connect cannot be used to improve\n                    application resiliency to handle spikes in traffic.\n </p>\n <p>\n  References:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/disaster-recovery-resiliency.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"

The sync\n                    command lists the source and target buckets to identify objects that are in the source bucket but\n                    that aren't in the target bucket. The command also identifies objects in the source bucket that have\n                    different LastModified dates than the objects that are in the target bucket. The sync command on a\n                    versioned bucket copies only the current version of the object—previous versions aren't copied. By\n                    default, this preserves object metadata, but the access control lists (ACLs) are set to FULL_CONTROL\n                    for your AWS account, which removes any additional ACLs.

By default, replication only\n                    supports copying new Amazon S3 objects after it is enabled using the AWS S3 console. Replication\n                    enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are\n                    configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.\n                    Object may be replicated to a single destination bucket or multiple destination buckets.

Whether your users\n                    sign-in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile\n                    that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).\n </p>\n <p>\n  User pools provide:\n                    1.

Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials,\n                    account takeover protection, and phone and email verification.\n                    6. Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.\n </p>\n <p>\n  After creating an Amazon Cognito user pool, in API Gateway, you must then create a\n                    COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizer that uses the user pool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Amazon Cognito User Pools:\n  <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q24-i1.jpg\" style=\"display: none;\"/>\n  <span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\">\n   <div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\">\n    <img alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt2-q24-i1.jpg\"/>\n    <button class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-large ud-btn-link ud-heading-md open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\" type=\"button\">\n     <svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\" focusable=\"false\" role=\"img\">\n      <use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\">\n      </use>\n     </svg>\n    </button>\n   </div>\n  </span>\n  via -\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use AWS_IAM authorization\n  </strong>\n  - For consumers who currently are located within your\n                    AWS environment or have the means to retrieve AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) temporary\n                    credentials to access your environment, you can use AWS_IAM authorization and add least-privileged\n                    permissions to the respective IAM role to securely invoke your API. API Gateway API Keys is not a\n                    security mechanism and should not be used for authorization unless it’s a public API. It should be\n                    used primarily to track a consumer’s usage across your API.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use API Gateway Lambda authorizer\n  </strong>\n  - If you have an existing Identity Provider\n                    (IdP), you can use an API Gateway Lambda authorizer to invoke a Lambda function to\n                    authenticate/validate a given user against your IdP. You can use a Lambda authorizer for custom\n                    validation logic based on identity metadata.\n </p>\n <p>\n  A Lambda authorizer can send additional information derived from a bearer token or request context\n                    values to your backend service. For example, the authorizer can return a map containing user IDs,\n                    user names, and scope. By using Lambda authorizers, your backend does not need to map authorization\n                    tokens to user-centric data, allowing you to limit the exposure of such information to just the\n                    authorization function.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When using Lambda authorizers, AWS strictly advises against passing credentials or any sort of\n                    sensitive data via query string parameters or headers, so this is not as secure as using Cognito\n                    User Pools.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In addition, both these options do not offer built-in user management.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use Amazon Cognito Identity Pools\n  </strong>\n  - The two main components of Amazon Cognito are\n                    user pools and identity pools. Identity pools provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to\n                    other AWS services. To enable users in your user pool to access AWS resources, you can configure an\n                    identity pool to exchange user pool tokens for AWS credentials. So, identity pools aren't an\n                    authentication mechanism in themselves and hence aren't a choice for this use case.\n </p>\n <p>\n  References:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/serverless-applications-lens/identity-and-access-management.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enable-cognito-user-pool.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enable-cognito-user-pool.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"

This type of deployment allows you to test features in\n                    the green environment without impacting the currently running version of your application. When\n                    you’re satisfied that the green version is working properly, you can gradually reroute the traffic\n                    from the old blue environment to the new green environment. Blue/green deployments can mitigate\n                    common risks associated with deploying software, such as downtime and rollback capability.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute a portion of traffic to a particular\n                      deployment\n  </strong>\n  - AWS Global Accelerator is a network layer service that directs traffic to\n                    optimal endpoints over the AWS global network, this improves the availability and performance of\n                    your internet applications. It provides two static anycast IP addresses that act as a fixed entry\n                    point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application\n                    Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Elastic IP addresses or Amazon EC2 instances, in a single or\n                    in multiple AWS regions.\n </p>\n <p>\n  AWS Global Accelerator uses endpoint weights to determine the proportion of traffic that is\n                    directed to endpoints in an endpoint group, and traffic dials to control the percentage of traffic\n                    that is directed to an endpoint group (an AWS region where your application is deployed).\n </p>\n <p>\n  While relying on the DNS service is a great option for blue/green deployments, it may not fit\n                    use-cases that require a fast and controlled transition of the traffic. Some client devices and\n                    internet resolvers cache DNS answers for long periods; this DNS feature improves the efficiency of\n                    the DNS service as it reduces the DNS traffic across the Internet, and serves as a resiliency\n                    technique by preventing authoritative name-server overloads. The downside of this in blue/green\n                    deployments is that you don’t know how long it will take before all of your users receive updated IP\n                    addresses when you update a record, change your routing preference or when there is an application\n                    failure.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With AWS Global Accelerator, you can shift traffic gradually or all at once between the blue and\n                    the green environment and vice-versa without being subject to DNS caching on client devices and\n                    internet resolvers, traffic dials and endpoint weights changes are effective within seconds.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use Route 53 weighted routing to spread traffic across different deployments\n  </strong>\n  -\n                    Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single domain name (example.com) or\n                    subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can\n                    be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of the\n                    software. As discussed earlier, DNS caching is a negative behavior for this use case and hence Route\n                    53 is not a good option.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic across deployments\n  </strong>\n  - An ELB can\n                    distribute traffic across healthy instances. You can also use the ALB weighted target groups feature\n                    for blue/green deployments as it does not rely on the DNS service. In addition you don’t need to\n                    create new ALBs for the green environment. As the use-case refers to a global application, so this\n                    option cannot be used for a multi-Region solution which is needed for the given requirement.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use AWS CodeDeploy deployment options to choose the right deployment\n  </strong>\n  - In\n                    CodeDeploy, a deployment is the process, and the components involved in the process, of installing\n                    content on one or more instances. This content can consist of code, web and configuration files,\n                    executables, packages, scripts, and so on. CodeDeploy deploys content that is stored in a source\n                    repository, according to the configuration rules you specify. Blue/Green deployment is one of the\n                    deployment types that CodeDeploy supports. CodeDeploy is not meant to distribute traffic across\n                    instances, so this option is incorrect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  References:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deployments\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/using-aws-global-accelerator-to-achieve-blue-green-deployments\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-weighted\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"

This enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, and\n                    not just with the VPC. Sites that use AWS Direct Connect connections to the virtual private gateway\n                    can also be part of the AWS VPN CloudHub. The VPN CloudHub operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model\n                    that you can use with or without a VPC. This design is suitable if you have multiple branch offices\n                    and existing internet connections and would like to implement a convenient, potentially low-cost\n                    hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity between these remote offices.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Per the given use-case, the corporate headquarters has an AWS Direct Connect connection to the VPC\n                    and the branch offices have Site-to-Site VPN connections to the VPC.

SQS eliminates\n                    the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and\n                    empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive\n                    messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other\n                    services to be available.\n </p>\n <p>\n  SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort\n                    ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are\n                    processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.\n </p>\n <p>\n  By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300\n                    messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second) without batching.\n                    Therefore, using batching you can meet a throughput requirement of upto 3,000 messages per second.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix. The suffix counts towards the 80-character\n                    queue name limit. To determine whether a queue is FIFO, you can check whether the queue name ends\n                    with the suffix.\n </p>\n <p>\n  If you have an existing application that uses standard queues and you want to take advantage of the\n                    ordering or exactly-once processing features of FIFO queues, you need to configure the queue and\n                    your application correctly. You can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. To make\n                    the move, you must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing\n                    standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Convert the existing standard queue into a FIFO queue\n  </strong>\n  - You can't convert an\n                    existing standard queue into a FIFO queue.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Make sure that the name of the FIFO queue is the same as the standard queue\n  </strong>\n  - The\n                    name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Make sure that the throughput for the target FIFO queue does not exceed 300 messages per\n                      second\n  </strong>\n  - By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching.\n </p>\n <p>\n  References:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"

On a static website, individual web pages include\n                    static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. To host a static website on Amazon S3,\n                    you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the\n                    bucket. When you configure a bucket as a static website, you must enable website hosting, set\n                    permissions, and create and add an index document. Depending on your website requirements, you can\n                    also configure redirects, web traffic logging, and a custom error document.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Distributing the static content through S3 allows us to offload most of the network usage to S3 and\n                    free up our applications running on ECS.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Distribute the dynamic content through Amazon S3\n  </strong>\n  - By contrast, a dynamic website\n                    relies on server-side processing, including server-side scripts such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET.

Specifically, API Gateway sets a limit on a\n                    steady-state rate and a burst of request submissions against all APIs in your account.

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) cannot buffer messages and is generally used with\n                    SQS to provide the buffering facility. When requests come in faster than your Lambda function can\n                    scale, or when your function is at maximum concurrency, additional requests fail as the Lambda\n                    throttles those requests with error code 429 status code. So, this combination of services is\n                    incorrect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Amazon Gateway Endpoints, Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis\n  </strong>\n  - A Gateway Endpoint is a\n                    gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a\n                    supported AWS service. This cannot help in throttling or buffering of requests. Amazon SQS and\n                    Kinesis can buffer incoming data.

The source\n                    database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that\n                    rely on the database. AWS Database Migration Service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle\n                    to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle\n                    or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Given the use-case where the CTO at the company wants to move away from license-based expensive,\n                    legacy commercial database solutions deployed at the on-premises data center to more efficient,\n                    open-source, and cost-effective options on AWS Cloud, this is an example of heterogeneous database\n                    migrations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For such a scenario, the source and target databases engines are different, like in the case of\n                    Oracle to Amazon Aurora, Oracle to PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL migrations. In this\n                    case, the schema structure, data types, and database code of source and target databases can be\n                    quite different, requiring a schema and code transformation before the data migration starts.\n </p>\n <p>\n  That makes heterogeneous migrations a two-step process. First use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to\n                    convert the source schema and code to match that of the target database, and then use the AWS\n                    Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database. All the\n                    required data type conversions will automatically be done by the AWS Database Migration Service\n                    during the migration. The source database can be located on your on-premises environment outside of\n                    AWS, running on an Amazon EC2 instance, or it can be an Amazon RDS database.

It provides\n                    up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gb network\n                    connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases. As each Snowball\n                    Edge Storage Optimized device can handle 80TB of data, you can order 10 such devices to take care of\n                    the data transfer for all applications. The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of\n                    service and Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer. You\n                    may see the Snowball device on the exam, just remember that the original Snowball device had 80TB of\n                    storage space. AWS Snowball Edge cannot be used for database migrations.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   AWS Glue\n  </strong>\n  - AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service\n                    that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue job is meant\n                    to be used for batch ETL data processing.

Basic Schema Copy\n                    will automatically create tables and primary keys in the target instance if the target does not\n                    already contain tables with the same names. Basic Schema Copy is great for doing a test migration,\n                    or when you are migrating databases heterogeneously e.g. Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to Oracle.\n                    Basic Schema Copy will not migrate secondary indexes, foreign keys or stored procedures. When you\n                    need to use a more customizable schema migration process (e.g. when you are migrating your\n                    production database and need to move your stored procedures and secondary database objects), you\n                    must use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool.\n </p>\n <p>\n  References:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dms/\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/dms/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dms/faqs/\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/dms/faqs/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dms/schema-conversion-tool/\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/dms/schema-conversion-tool/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"

The service\n                    uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence to identify and\n                    prioritize potential threats.\n </p>\n <p>\n  GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, such as AWS\n                    CloudTrail events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.\n </p>\n <p>\n  With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, GuardDuty can be enabled with no software or\n                    hardware to deploy or maintain. By integrating with Amazon EventBridge Events, GuardDuty alerts are\n                    actionable, easy to aggregate across multiple accounts, and straightforward to push into existing\n                    event management and workflow systems.\n </p>\n <p>\n  How GuardDuty works:\n  <img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Amazon%20GuardDuty/product-page-diagram-Amazon-GuardDuty_how-it-works.a4daf7e3aaf3532623a3797dd3af606a85fc2e7b.png\" style=\"display: none;\"/>\n  <span class=\"ud-component--base-components--open-full-size-image\">\n   <div class=\"open-full-size-image--wrapper--R4gIm\" data-purpose=\"open-full-size-image\">\n    <img alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Amazon%20GuardDuty/product-page-diagram-Amazon-GuardDuty_how-it-works.a4daf7e3aaf3532623a3797dd3af606a85fc2e7b.png\"/>\n    <button class=\"ud-btn ud-btn-large ud-btn-link ud-heading-md open-full-size-image--backdrop--Zor3j\" type=\"button\">\n     <svg aria-label=\"Larger image\" class=\"ud-icon ud-icon-large ud-icon-color-neutral\" focusable=\"false\" role=\"img\">\n      <use xlink:href=\"#icon-search\">\n      </use>\n     </svg>\n    </button>\n   </div>\n  </span>\n  via -\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   VPC Flow Logs, API Gateway logs, S3 access logs\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   ELB logs, DNS logs, CloudTrail events\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   CloudFront logs, API Gateway logs, CloudTrail events\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  These three options contradict the explanation provided above, so these options are incorrect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Reference:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/\">\n   https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"

    "question": "A retail company uses AWS Cloud to manage its IT infrastructure. The company has set up \"AWS\n                    Organizations\" to manage several departments running their AWS accounts and using resources such as\n                    EC2 instances and RDS databases. The company wants to provide shared and centrally-managed VPCs to\n                    all departments using applications that need a high degree of interconnectivity.\nAs a solutions architect, which of the following options would you choose to facilitate this\n                    use-case?",
    "choices": [
      "Use VPC sharing to share a VPC with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization\n                      from AWS Organizations",
      "Use VPC peering to share a VPC with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization\n                      from AWS Organizations",
      "Use VPC peering to share one or more subnets with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent\n                      organization from AWS Organizations",

    "explanation_html": "<div class=\"ud-text-md rt-scaffolding\" data-purpose=\"safely-set-inner-html:rich-text-viewer:html\" id=\"overall-explanation\">\n <p>\n  Correct option:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use VPC sharing to share one or more subnets with other AWS accounts belonging to the same\n                      parent organization from AWS Organizations\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  VPC sharing (part of Resource Access Manager) allows multiple AWS accounts to create their\n                    application resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Redshift clusters, and Lambda functions,\n                    into shared and centrally-managed Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). To set this up, the account\n                    that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong\n                    to the same organization from AWS Organizations. After a subnet is shared, the participants can\n                    view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them.\n                    Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC\n                    owner.\n </p>\n <p>\n  You can share Amazon VPCs to leverage the implicit routing within a VPC for applications that\n                    require a high degree of interconnectivity and are within the same trust boundaries. This reduces\n                    the number of VPCs that you create and manage while using separate accounts for billing and access\n                    control.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Incorrect options:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use VPC sharing to share a VPC with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent\n                      organization from AWS Organizations\n  </strong>\n  - Using VPC sharing, an account that owns the VPC\n                    (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same\n                    organization from AWS Organizations. The owner account cannot share the VPC itself. Therefore this\n                    option is incorrect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use VPC peering to share one or more subnets with other AWS accounts belonging to the same\n                      parent organization from AWS Organizations\n  </strong>\n  - A VPC peering connection is a networking\n                    connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4\n                    addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are\n                    within the same network. VPC peering does not facilitate centrally managed VPCs. Therefore this\n                    option is incorrect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Use VPC peering to share a VPC with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent\n                      organization from AWS Organizations\n  </strong>\n  - A VPC peering connection is a networking connection\n                    between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6\n                    addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same\n                    network. VPC peering does not facilitate centrally managed VPCs. Moreover, an AWS owner account\n                    cannot share the VPC itself with another AWS account. Therefore this option is incorrect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  References:\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html\">\n   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html\n  </a>\n </p>\n</div>\n"
