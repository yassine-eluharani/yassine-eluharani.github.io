Amazon Kinesis offers key capabilities to\n            cost-effectively process streaming data at any scale, along with the flexibility to choose the tools that\n            best suit the requirements of your application.</p>\n<p>With Amazon Kinesis, you can ingest real-time data such as video, audio, application logs, website\n            clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data for machine learning, analytics, and other applications. Amazon Kinesis\n            enables you to process and analyze data as it arrives and respond instantly instead of having to wait until\n            all your data is collected before the processing can begin.</p>\n<p>Amazon Kinesis will be great for event streaming from the IoT devices, but not for sending notifications as\n            it doesn't have such a feature.</p>\n<p>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed\n            pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless\n            applications. Amazon SNS provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging. Amazon SNS\n            is a notification service and will be perfect for this use case.</p>\n<p>Streaming data with Amazon Kinesis and using Amazon SNS to send the response notifications is the optimal\n            solution for the current scenario.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) with Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon\n              SNS)</strong> - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables\n            you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SQS\n            eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message-oriented middleware\n            and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive\n            messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to\n            be available. Kinesis is better for streaming data since queues aren't meant for real-time streaming of\n            data.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis with Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)</strong> - Amazon Simple Email Service\n            (Amazon SES) is a cloud-based email sending service designed to help digital marketers and application\n            developers send marketing, notification, and transactional emails. It is a reliable, cost-effective service\n            for businesses of all sizes that use email to keep in contact with their customers. It is an email service\n            and not a notification service as is the requirement in the current use case.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon Kinesis with Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)</strong> - As explained above, Amazon\n            Kinesis works well for streaming real-time data. Amazon SQS is a queuing service that helps decouple system\n            architecture by offering flexibility and ease of maintenance. It cannot send notifications. Amazon SQS is\n            paired with SNS to provide this functionality.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">https://aws.amazon.com/sns/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/\">https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\">https://aws.amazon.com/ses/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>"

An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\n            features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in\n            an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\n            service.</p>\n<p>You configure the size of your Auto Scaling group by setting the minimum, maximum, and desired capacity.\n            The minimum and maximum capacity are required to create an Auto Scaling group, while the desired capacity is\n            optional. If you do not define your desired capacity upfront, it defaults to your minimum capacity.</p>\n<p>An Auto Scaling group is elastic as long as it has different values for minimum and maximum capacity. All\n            requests to change the Auto Scaling group's desired capacity (either by manual scaling or automatic scaling)\n            must fall within these limits.</p>\n<p>Here, even though our ASG is deployed across 3 Availability Zones (AZs), the minimum capacity to be highly\n            available is 2. When we specify 2 as the minimum capacity, the ASG would create these 2 instances in\n            separate Availability Zones (AZs). If demand goes up, the ASG would spin up a new instance in the third\n            Availability Zone (AZ). Later as the demand subsides, the ASG would scale-in and the instance count would be\n            back to 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Reserved Instances (RIs) for the minimum capacity</strong></p>\n<p>Reserved Instances (RIs) provide you with significant savings on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to\n            On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount\n            applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. These On-Demand Instances must match certain\n            attributes, such as instance type and Region, to benefit from the billing discount. Since minimum capacity\n            will always be maintained, it is cost-effective to choose reserved instances than any other option.</p>\n<p>In case of an Availability Zone (AZ) outage, the instance in that Availability Zone (AZ) would go down\n            however the other instance would still be available. The ASG would provision the replacement instance in the\n            third Availability Zone (AZ) to keep the minimum count to 2.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Set the minimum capacity to 1</strong> - This is not failure proof, since only one instance will be\n            maintained consistently and this will be from only one Availability Zone (AZ).</p>\n<p><strong>Set the minimum capacity to 3</strong> - This is not a cost-effective option, as two instances in\n            two different Availability Zones (AZs) are enough to make the architecture disaster-proof.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Dedicated hosts for the minimum capacity</strong> - As there is no use-case to utilize existing\n            per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses or to run the instance on a dedicated physical host, so\n            the option to use dedicated hosts for the minimum capacity is ruled out.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-capacity-limits.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-capacity-limits.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Whenever an application creates, updates, or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes\n            a stream record with the primary key attributes of the items that were modified.

You must specify an\n            AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple\n            instances with the same configuration.

As your number of workloads running on AWS increases, you need to be able to scale your\n            networks across multiple accounts and Amazon VPCs to keep up with the growth. With AWS Transit Gateway, you\n            only have to create and manage a single connection from the central gateway into each Amazon VPC,\n            on-premises data center, or remote office across your network. AWS Transit Gateway acts as a hub that\n            controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, which act like spokes. This hub and spoke\n            model simplifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only has to connect to the\n            Transit Gateway and not to every other network.</p>\n<p>AWS Transit Gateway:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q28-i1.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/\">https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Transit VPC Solution to connect the Amazon VPCs to the on-premises networks</strong> - The\n            Transit VPC can be used to enable connectivity between various VPC’s in different regions and customer data\n            centers. You can use this to connect multiple VPCs that are geographically disparate and/or running in\n            separate AWS accounts, to a common VPC that serves as a global network transit center. This network topology\n            simplifies network management and minimizes the number of connections that you need to set up.</p>\n<p>Transit VPC:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q28-i2.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/\">https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/</a>\n</p>\n<p>Transit VPC is not the right solution for this use-case as Transit Gateway provides several advantages over\n            Transit VPC:\n            1. Transit Gateway abstracts away the complexity of maintaining VPN connections with hundreds of VPCs.\n            2. Transit Gateway removes the need to manage and scale Amazon EC2 based software appliances. AWS is\n            responsible for managing all resources needed to route traffic.\n            3. Transit Gateway removes the need to manage high availability by providing a highly available and\n            redundant Multi-AZ infrastructure.\n            4. Transit Gateway improves bandwidth for inter-VPC communication to burst speeds of 50 Gbps per\n            Availability Zone (AZ).\n            5. Transit Gateway streamlines user costs to a simple per hour per/GB transferred model.\n            6. Transit Gateway decreases latency by removing Amazon EC2 proxies and the need for VPN encapsulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Partially meshed VPC peering can be used to connect the Amazon VPCs to the on-premises\n              networks</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Fully meshed VPC peering can be used to connect the Amazon VPCs to the on-premises\n              networks</strong></p>\n<p>The simplest way to connect two VPCs is to use VPC Peering. In this setup, a connection enables full\n            bidirectional connectivity between the VPCs. This peering connection is used to route traffic between the\n            VPCs. VPCs across accounts and AWS Regions can also be peered together. VPC peering only incurs costs for\n            traffic traveling over the connection (there is no hourly infrastructure fee).</p>\n<p>VPC peering is point-to-point connectivity, and it does not support transitive routing. If you are using\n            VPC peering, on-premises connectivity (VPN and/or Direct Connect) must be made to each VPC. Resources in a\n            VPC cannot reach on-premises using the hybrid connectivity of a peered VPC. VPC peering is best used when\n            resources in one VPC must communicate with resources in another VPC, the environment of both VPCs is\n            controlled and secured, and the number of VPCs to be connected is less than 10 (to allow for the individual\n            management of each connection). VPC peering offers the lowest overall cost when compared to other options\n            for inter-VPC connectivity.</p>\n<p>Network setup using VPC Peering:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q28-i3.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/vpc-peering.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/vpc-peering.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>You cannot use VPC Peering to establish on-premises connectivity with AWS Cloud, so both these options are\n            incorrect.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/transit-gateway-vs-transit-vpc.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/transit-gateway-vs-transit-vpc.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/vpc-peering.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/vpc-peering.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

The object may be replicated to a single\n            destination bucket or multiple destination buckets. Both source and destination buckets must have versioning\n            enabled. By default, when Amazon S3 Replication is enabled and an object is deleted in the source bucket,\n            Amazon S3 adds a delete marker in the source bucket only. This action protects data from malicious\n            deletions. If you have delete marker replication enabled, these markers are copied to the destination\n            buckets, and Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted in both source and destination buckets. However,\n            someone with administrative access to Amazon S3 can disable cross-Region replication and then delete all\n            versions from both source as well as the destination, so this option will not be able to safeguard your data\n            compared to Amazon S3 Object Lock.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) delete on the Amazon S3 bucket</strong> - When\n            working with Amazon S3 Versioning in Amazon S3 buckets, you can optionally add another layer of security by\n            configuring a bucket to enable MFA (multi-factor authentication) delete.

AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices provide 40 vCPUs of compute\n            capacity coupled with 80 terabytes of usable block or Amazon S3-compatible object storage. It is well-suited\n            for local storage and large-scale data transfer. AWS Snowball Edge Compute Optimized devices provide 52\n            vCPUs, 42 terabytes of usable block or object storage, and an optional GPU for use cases such as advanced\n            machine learning and full-motion video analysis in disconnected environments.</p>\n<p>Customers can use these two options for data collection, machine learning and processing, and storage in\n            environments with intermittent connectivity (such as manufacturing, industrial, and transportation) or in\n            extremely remote locations (such as military or maritime operations) before shipping it back to AWS.

The volumes types fall\n            into two categories:</p>\n<p>SSD-backed volumes optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write operations with\n            small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS.</p>\n<p>HDD-backed volumes optimized for large streaming workloads where throughput (measured in MiB/s) is a better\n            performance measure than IOPS</p>\n<p>Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly\n            database workloads, that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency. Unlike gp2, which uses a\n            bucket and credit model to calculate performance, an io1 volume allows you to specify a consistent IOPS rate\n            when you create the volume, and Amazon EBS delivers the provisioned performance 99.9 percent of the time.\n          </p>\n<p><strong>Convert the Amazon EC2 instance EBS volume to gp2</strong></p>\n<p>General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of\n            workloads. These volumes deliver single-digit millisecond latencies and the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS\n            for an extended duration. Between a minimum of 100 IOPS (at 33.33 GiB and below) and a maximum of 16,000\n            IOPS (at 5,334 GiB and above), baseline performance scales linearly at 3 IOPS per GiB of volume size. AWS\n            designs gp2 volumes to deliver a provisioned performance of 99% uptime. A gp2 volume can range in size from\n            1 GiB to 16 TiB.</p>\n<p>Therefore, gp2 is the right choice as it is more cost-effective than io1, and it also allows a burst in\n            performance when needed.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Keep the Amazon EBS volume to io1 and reduce the IOPS</strong> - Keeping the Amazon EBS volume to\n            io1 and reducing the IOPS may interfere with the burst of performance we need, so this option is ruled out.\n          </p>\n<p><strong>Change the Amazon EC2 instance type to something much smaller</strong> - Changing the Amazon EC2\n            instance type to something much smaller won't affect 90% of the costs that are incurred, therefore this\n            option is also incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't use a AWS CloudFormation template to create the database as the AWS CloudFormation service\n              incurs greater service charges</strong> - This statement is incorrect as AWS CloudFormation is a free\n            service to use.

For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)\n            load balancer in the Frankfurt region.</p>\n<p>When you use geolocation routing, you can localize your content and present some or all of your website in\n            the language of your users. You can also use geolocation routing to restrict the distribution of content to\n            only the locations in which you have distribution rights. Another possible use is for balancing load across\n            endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way so that each user location is consistently routed to the same\n            endpoint.</p>\n<p><strong>Latency-based routing</strong> - If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can\n            improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest\n            latency.</p>\n<p>To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions. When\n            Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain (example.com or acme.example.com), it\n            determines which AWS Regions you've created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the\n            lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Amazon Route 53 responds with the value\n            from the selected record, such as the IP address for a web server.</p>\n<p><strong>Weighted routing</strong> - Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resources with a single\n            domain name (example.com) or subdomain name (acme.example.com) and choose how much traffic is routed to each\n            resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of\n            software.</p>\n<p>To configure weighted routing, you create records that have the same name and type for each of your\n            resources. You assign each record a relative weight that corresponds with how much traffic you want to send\n            to each resource.

A warm standby solution extends the pilot light\n            elements and preparation. It further decreases the recovery time because some services are always running.\n            By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate these systems on AWS and have them\n            always on.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Backup and Restore</strong> - In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and sent\n            off-site regularly. If you use this method, it can take a long time to restore your system in the event of a\n            disruption or disaster. Amazon S3 is an ideal destination for backup data that might be needed quickly to\n            perform a restore. Transferring data to and from Amazon S3 is typically done through the network, and is\n            therefore accessible from any location. Many commercial and open-source backup solutions integrate with\n            Amazon S3.</p>\n<p><strong>Pilot Light</strong> - The term pilot light is often used to describe a DR scenario in which a\n            minimal version of an environment is always running in the cloud. The idea of the pilot light is an analogy\n            that comes from the gas heater. In a gas heater, a small flame that’s always on can quickly ignite the\n            entire furnace to heat up a house. This scenario is similar to a backup-and-restore scenario. For example,\n            with AWS you can maintain a pilot light by configuring and running the most critical core elements of your\n            system in AWS. When the time comes for recovery, you can rapidly provision a full-scale production\n            environment around the critical core.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi Site</strong> - A multi-site solution runs in AWS as well as on your existing on-site\n            infrastructure, in an active-active configuration. The data replication method that you employ will be\n            determined by the recovery point that you choose.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-disaster-recovery.pdf\">https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-disaster-recovery.pdf</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/asset-repository/products/CloudEndure/CloudEndure_Affordable_Enterprise-Grade_Disaster_Recovery_Using_AWS.pdf\">https://d1.awsstatic.com/asset-repository/products/CloudEndure/CloudEndure_Affordable_Enterprise-Grade_Disaster_Recovery_Using_AWS.pdf</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

With AWS CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity\n            related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. AWS CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account\n            activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and\n            other AWS services.</p>\n<p>In general, to analyze any API calls made within an AWS account, AWS CloudTrail is used. You can record the\n            actions that are taken by users, roles, or AWS services on Amazon S3 resources and maintain log records for\n            auditing and compliance purposes. To do this, you can use server access logging, AWS CloudTrail logging, or\n            a combination of both.

A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines\n            their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request.\n            Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in\n            AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies,\n            permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP), access control list (ACL), and\n            session policies.</p>\n<p>Implementing an IAM policy to forbid users would be disruptive and wouldn't go unnoticed.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon S3 access logs to analyze user access using Athena</strong> - Amazon S3 server access\n            logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. Server access logs are useful\n            for many applications. For example, access log information can be useful in security and access audits. It\n            can also help you learn about your customer base and understand your Amazon S3 bill. AWS recommends that you\n            use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Amazon S3 resources, as it provides\n            more options to store, analyze and act on the log information.</p>\n<p><strong>Implement a bucket policy requiring AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) for all\n              operations</strong> - Amazon S3 supports MFA-protected API access, a feature that can enforce multi-factor\n            authentication (MFA) for access to your Amazon S3 resources. Multi-factor authentication provides an extra\n            level of security that you can apply to your AWS environment.

It delivers high performance and availability with up to 15 low-latency read\n            replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability\n            Zones (AZs).</p>\n<p>Aurora Replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations.\n            Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones (AZs) that a DB cluster spans\n            within an AWS Region. The DB cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of the data for the DB cluster.\n            However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical volume to the primary instance\n            and Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. You can also set up two Aurora MySQL DB clusters in different AWS\n            Regions, by creating an Aurora Read Replica of an Amazon Aurora MySQL DB cluster in a different AWS Region.\n            In this way, Aurora Read Replicas can be deployed globally.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Aurora Multi-AZ</strong> - Aurora, stores copies of the data in a DB cluster across\n            multiple Availability Zones in a single AWS Region, regardless of whether the instances in the DB cluster\n            span multiple Availability Zones (AZs). When data is written to the primary DB instance, Aurora\n            synchronously replicates the data across Availability Zones (AZs) to six storage nodes associated with your\n            cluster volume. Doing so provides data redundancy, eliminates I/O freezes, and minimizes latency spikes\n            during system backups. Always remember that the main purpose for multi-AZ is high availability whereas the\n            main purpose of read replicas is read scalability.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB Streams</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB Streams is a powerful service that you can\n            combine with other AWS services to solve many problems. When enabled, DynamoDB Streams captures a\n            time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in a DynamoDB table and durably stores the information for\n            up to 24 hours. Applications can access a series of stream records, which contain an item change, from a\n            DynamoDB stream in near real-time.</p>\n<p><strong>Create an AWS Lambda function to periodically back up and restore the Amazon Aurora database in\n              another region</strong> - AWS Lambda can be used to create backups for Amazon RDS.

An internet gateway serves two\n            purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and to perform network\n            address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses. An internet gateway\n            supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.</p>\n<p>To enable access to or from the internet for instances in a subnet in a VPC, you must do the following:\n            1. Attach an internet gateway to your VPC.\n            2. Add a route to your subnet's route table that directs internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway.\n            3.

When you\n            launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups; otherwise, AWS uses the default security\n            group. You can add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. You\n            can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all\n            instances that are associated with the security group.

An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto\n            Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies.

When you\n            launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups; otherwise, we use the default security\n            group. You can add rules to each security group that allow traffic to or from its associated instances. You\n            can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all\n            instances that are associated with the security group. When deciding to allow traffic to reach an instance,\n            all the rules from all the security groups that are associated with the instance are evaluated.</p>\n<p>The following are the characteristics of security group rules:\n            1.

Amazon Route\n            53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS – such as Amazon EC2 instances,\n            Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets – and can also be used to route users to\n            infrastructure outside of AWS.</p>\n<p>You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints or to\n            independently monitor the health of your application and its endpoints. Amazon Route 53 Traffic Flow makes\n            it easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of routing types, including Latency Based\n            Routing, Geo DNS, Geoproximity, and Weighted Round Robin—all of which can be combined with DNS Failover to\n            enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant architectures.</p>\n<p><strong>The Time To Live (TTL) is still in effect</strong></p>\n<p>TTL (time to live), is the amount of time, in seconds, that you want DNS recursive resolvers to cache\n            information about a record. If you specify a longer value (for example, 172800 seconds, or two days), you\n            reduce the number of calls that DNS recursive resolvers must make to Amazon Route 53 to get the latest\n            information for the record. This has the effect of reducing latency and reducing your bill for Route 53\n            service.</p>\n<p>However, if you specify a longer value for TTL, it takes longer for changes to the record (for example, a\n            new IP address) to take effect because recursive resolvers use the values in their cache for longer periods\n            before they ask Route 53 for the latest information. If you're changing settings for a domain or subdomain\n            that's already in use, AWS recommends that you initially specify a shorter value, such as 300 seconds, and\n            increase the value after you confirm that the new settings are correct.</p>\n<p>For this use-case, the most likely issue is that the TTL is still in effect so you have to wait until it\n            expires for the new request to perform another DNS query and get the value for the new Load Balancer.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>The CNAME Record is misconfigured</strong> - A CNAME record can redirect DNS queries to any DNS\n            record. For example, you can create a CNAME record that redirects queries from acme.example.com to\n            zenith.example.com or to acme.example.org. You don't need to use Amazon Route 53 as the DNS service for the\n            domain that you're redirecting queries to.</p>\n<p><strong>The Alias Record is misconfigured</strong> - Amazon Route 53 also offers alias records, which are\n            an Amazon Route 53-specific extension to DNS. Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources,\n            such as Amazon CloudFront distributions and Amazon S3 buckets. They also let you route traffic from one\n            record in a hosted zone to another record.\n            Unlike a CNAME record, you can create an alias record at the top node of a DNS namespace, also known as the\n            zone apex. For example, if you register the DNS name example.com, the zone apex is example.com. You can't\n            create a CNAME record for example.com, but you can create an alias record for example.com that routes\n            traffic to www.example.com.</p>\n<p><strong>The health checks are failing</strong> - Simple Records do not have health checks, so this option\n            is incorrect.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/route53/\">https://aws.amazon.com/route53/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-basic.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-values-basic.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

You\n            can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs\n            of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the\n            following placement strategies:</p>\n<p>Cluster – packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone (AZ). This strategy enables workloads\n            to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that\n            is typical of HPC applications.</p>\n<p>Partition – spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition\n            do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is\n            typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.</p>\n<p>Spread – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce\n            correlated failures.</p>\n<p>There is no charge for creating a placement group.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a Cluster placement group</strong></p>\n<p>A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone (AZ). A\n            cluster placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Region. Instances in the same cluster placement\n            group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit of up to 10 Gbps for TCP/IP traffic and are placed in the\n            same high-bisection bandwidth segment of the network.</p>\n<p>Cluster placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high\n            network throughput, or both. They are also recommended when the majority of the network traffic is between\n            the instances in the group.

You\n            can use Amazon CloudFront to improve the performance of your website. Amazon CloudFront makes your website\n            files (such as HTML, images, and video) available from data centers around the world (called edge\n            locations). When a visitor requests a file from your website, CloudFront automatically redirects the request\n            to a copy of the file at the nearest edge location. This results in faster download times than if the\n            visitor had requested the content from a data center that is located farther away.</p>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront is not a good solution here as the content is highly dynamic, and Amazon CloudFront will\n            cache things.</p>\n<p><strong>Deploy the website on Amazon S3</strong> - You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a\n            static website, individual web pages include static content. They might also contain client-side scripts. To\n            host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload\n            your website content to the bucket. When you configure a bucket as a static website, you enable static\n            website hosting, set permissions, and add an index document.

A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource,\n            defines their permissions.\n            Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource such as an Amazon S3 bucket.\n            These policies grant the specified principal permission to perform specific actions on that resource and\n            define under what conditions this applies.</p>\n<p><strong>Trust policy</strong></p>\n<p>Trust policies define which principal entities (accounts, users, roles, and federated users) can assume the\n            role. An IAM role is both an identity and a resource that supports resource-based policies. For this reason,\n            you must attach both a trust policy and an identity-based policy to an IAM role. The IAM service supports\n            only one type of resource-based policy called a role trust policy, which is attached to an IAM role.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCP)</strong> - If you enable all features of AWS\n            organization, then you can apply service control policies (SCPs) to any or all of your accounts. SCPs are\n            JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU). The SCP\n            limits permissions for entities in member accounts, including each AWS account root user. An explicit deny\n            in any of these policies overrides the allow.</p>\n<p><strong>Access control list (ACL)</strong> - Access control lists (ACLs) are service policies that allow\n            you to control which principals in another account can access a resource. ACLs cannot be used to control\n            access for a principal within the same account. Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services\n            that support ACLs.</p>\n<p><strong>Permissions boundary</strong> - AWS supports permissions boundaries for IAM entities (users or\n            roles). A permissions boundary is an advanced feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum\n            permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary\n            allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its\n            permissions boundaries.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_resource-based\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_resource-based</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

It’s always been possible to use wildcard and subject-alternate-name (SAN) certificates with ALB,\n            but these come with limitations. Wildcard certificates only work for related subdomains that match a simple\n            pattern and while SAN certificates can support many different domains, the same certificate authority has to\n            authenticate each one.

APIs act as the \"front door\" for applications to access\n            data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful\n            APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports\n            containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.</p>\n<p>You can enable Amazon API caching in Amazon API Gateway to cache your endpoint's responses. With caching,\n            you can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of requests to your\n            API.\n            When you enable caching for a stage, API Gateway caches responses from your endpoint for a specified\n            time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds. Amazon API Gateway then responds to the request by looking up the\n            endpoint response from the cache instead of requesting your endpoint. The default TTL value for API caching\n            is 300 seconds. The maximum TTL value is 3600 seconds. TTL=0 means caching is disabled. Using API Gateway\n            Caching feature is the answer for the use case, as we can accept stale data for about 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Add Amazon Aurora Read Replicas</strong> - Amazon Aurora features a distributed, fault-tolerant,\n            self-healing storage system that auto-scales up to 64TB per database instance. It delivers high performance\n            and availability with up to 15 low-latency read replicas, point-in-time recovery, continuous backup to\n            Amazon S3, and replication across three Availability Zones (AZs).</p>\n<p>Amazon Aurora Read Replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read\n            operations and increasing availability. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability\n            Zones that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region. The DB cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of\n            the data for the DB cluster. However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical\n            volume to the primary instance and to Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. Adding Aurora Read Replicas would\n            greatly increase the cost, therefore this option is ruled out.</p>\n<p><strong>Switch to using an Application Load Balancer</strong> - An Application Load Balancer functions at\n            the application layer, the seventh layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. After the load\n            balancer receives a request, it evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to\n            apply, and then selects a target from the target group for the rule action. You can configure listener rules\n            to route requests to different target groups based on the content of the application traffic. Switching to a\n            Load Balancer would not improve the current status as we need a caching mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>Enable AWS Lambda In Memory Caching</strong> - AWS Lambda has no native in-memory caching\n            capability.

The idea of the pilot light is an analogy that comes from the gas heater. In\n            a gas heater, a small flame that’s always on can quickly ignite the entire furnace to heat up a house. This\n            scenario is similar to a backup-and-restore scenario. For example, with AWS you can maintain a pilot light\n            by configuring and running the most critical core elements of your system in AWS. For the given use-case, a\n            small part of the backup infrastructure is always running simultaneously syncing mutable data (such as\n            databases or documents) so that there is no loss of critical data. When the time comes for recovery, you can\n            rapidly provision a full-scale production environment around the critical core. For Pilot light, RPO/RTO is\n            in 10s of minutes, so this is the correct solution.</p>\n<p>Four Disaster Recovery scenarios:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q24-i1.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Backup and Restore</strong> - In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and sent\n            off-site regularly. If you use this method, it can take a long time to restore your system in the event of a\n            disruption or disaster. Amazon S3 is an ideal destination for backup data that might be needed quickly to\n            perform a restore. Transferring data to and from Amazon S3 is typically done through the network and is\n            therefore accessible from any location. There are many commercial and open-source backup solutions that\n            integrate with Amazon S3. You can use AWS Import/Export to transfer very large data sets by shipping storage\n            devices directly to AWS. For longer-term data storage where retrieval times of several hours are adequate,\n            there is Amazon Glacier, which has the same durability model as Amazon S3. Amazon Glacier is a low-cost\n            alternative starting from $0.01/GB per month. Amazon Glacier and Amazon S3 can be used in conjunction to\n            produce a tiered backup solution. Even though Backup and Restore method is cheaper, it has an RPO in hours,\n            so this option is not the right fit.</p>\n<p><strong>Warm Standby</strong> - The term warm standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a\n            scaled-down version of a fully functional environment is always running in the cloud. A warm standby\n            solution extends the pilot light elements and preparation. It further decreases the recovery time because\n            some services are always running. By identifying your business-critical systems, you can fully duplicate\n            these systems on AWS and have them always on. This option is costlier compared to Pilot Light.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-Site</strong> - A multi-site solution runs on AWS as well as on your existing on-site\n            infrastructure in an active-active configuration. The data replication method that you employ will be\n            determined by the recovery point that you choose, either Recovery Time Objective (the maximum allowable\n            downtime before degraded operations are restored) or Recovery Point Objective (the maximum allowable time\n            window whereby you will accept the loss of transactions during the DR process). This option is more costly\n            compared to Pilot Light.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/rapidly-recover-mission-critical-systems-in-a-disaster/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/rapidly-recover-mission-critical-systems-in-a-disaster/</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/plan-for-disaster-recovery-dr.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/disaster-recovery-dr-objectives.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

There is no concept of\n            provisioned capacity, and there is no delay waiting for Amazon CloudWatch thresholds or the subsequent table\n            updates. On-demand is ideal for bursty, new, or unpredictable workloads whose traffic can spike in seconds\n            or minutes, and when underprovisioned capacity would impact the user experience. On-demand is a perfect\n            solution if your team is moving to a NoOps or serverless environment.</p>\n<p>The given use case clearly states that when the traffic spikes occur they happen very quickly, thereby\n            implying an unpredictable traffic pattern, therefore the on-demand capacity mode is the correct option for\n            the given use case.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon DynamoDB table in the provisioned capacity mode with auto-scaling enabled</strong> -\n            As mentioned in the explanation above, you should use the provisioned capacity mode (even with auto-scaling)\n            only when you have predictable application traffic.</p>\n<p>When you create Amazon DynamoDB table, auto-scaling is the default capacity setting, but you can also\n            enable auto-scaling on any table that does not have it active. Behind the scenes, as illustrated in the\n            following diagram, DynamoDB auto scaling uses a scaling policy in Application Auto Scaling. To configure\n            auto-scaling in DynamoDB, you set the minimum and maximum levels of read and write capacity in addition to\n            the target utilization percentage. Auto-scaling uses Amazon CloudWatch to monitor a table’s read and write\n            capacity metrics. To do so, it creates CloudWatch alarms that track consumed capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon DynamoDB table with a global secondary index</strong> - A global secondary index\n            (GSI) is an index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the base table. A\n            global secondary index is considered \"global\" because queries on the index can span all of the data in the\n            base table, across all partitions. A global secondary index is stored in its own partition space away from\n            the base table and scales separately from the base table. GSI cannot be used to handle an unpredictable load\n            on a DynamoDB table.</p>\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon DynamoDB global table in the provisioned capacity mode</strong> - Global tables build\n            on the global Amazon DynamoDB footprint to provide you with a fully managed, multi-Region, and multi-active\n            database that delivers fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications.\n            Global tables replicate your DynamoDB tables automatically across your choice of AWS Regions.</p>\n<p>Global tables eliminate the difficult work of replicating data between Regions and resolving update\n            conflicts, enabling you to focus on your application's business logic.

The sync\n            command lists the source and target buckets to identify objects that are in the source bucket but that\n            aren't in the target bucket. The command also identifies objects in the source bucket that have different\n            LastModified dates than the objects that are in the target bucket. The sync command on a versioned bucket\n            copies only the current version of the object—previous versions aren't copied. By default, this preserves\n            object metadata, but the access control lists (ACLs) are set to FULL_CONTROL for your AWS account, which\n            removes any additional ACLs. If the operation fails, you can run the sync command again without duplicating\n            previously copied objects.</p>\n<p>You can use the command like so:</p>\n<p><code>aws s3 sync s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-SOURCE s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-TARGET</code></p>\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon S3 batch replication to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in another Region using\n              S3 console and then delete the replication configuration</strong></p>\n<p>Amazon S3 Batch Replication provides you a way to replicate objects that existed before a replication\n            configuration was in place, objects that have previously been replicated, and objects that have failed\n            replication. This is done through the use of a Batch Operations job.</p>\n<p>You should note that batch replication differs from live replication which continuously and automatically\n            replicates new objects across Amazon S3 buckets. You cannot directly use the AWS S3 console to configure\n            cross-Region replication for existing objects. By default, replication only supports copying new Amazon S3\n            objects after it is enabled using the AWS S3 console. Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of\n            objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the\n            same AWS account or by different accounts. Object may be replicated to a single destination bucket or\n            multiple destination buckets. Destination buckets can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region\n            as the source bucket. Once done, you can delete the replication configuration, as it ensures that batch\n            replication is only used for this one-time data copy operation.</p>\n<p>If you want to enable live replication for existing objects for your bucket, you must contact AWS Support\n            and raise a support ticket. This is required to ensure that replication is configured correctly.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Snowball Edge device to copy the data from one Region to another Region</strong> - As the\n            given requirement is about copying the data from one AWS Region to another AWS Region, so AWS Snowball Edge\n            cannot be used here.

You can use AWS Snowball Edge Storage\n            Optimized if you have a large backlog of data to transfer or if you frequently collect data that needs to be\n            transferred to AWS and your storage is in an area where high-bandwidth internet connections are not\n            available or cost-prohibitive. AWS Snowball Edge can operate in remote locations or harsh operating\n            environments, such as factory floors, oil and gas rigs, mining sites, hospitals, and on moving vehicles.</p>\n<p><strong>Copy data from the source Amazon S3 bucket to a target Amazon S3 bucket using the S3\n              console</strong> - AWS S3 console cannot be used to copy 1 petabytes of data from one bucket to another as\n            it's not feasible. You should note that this option is different from using the replication options on the\n            AWS console, since here you are using the copy and paste options provided on the AWS console, which is\n            suggested for small or medium data volume. You should use S3 sync for the requirement of one-time copy of\n            data.</p>\n<p><strong>Set up Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in\n              different Regions using S3 console</strong> - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) is a\n            bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your\n            client and an Amazon S3 bucket.

DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB\n            tables, without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management.\n          </p>\n<p>DAX will be transparent and won't require an application refactoring, and will cache the \"hotkeys\".\n            Therefore, this is the correct option.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables builds upon DynamoDB’s\n            global footprint to provide you with a fully managed, multi-region, and multi-master database that provides\n            fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications.

But Global Tables cannot\n            address the hotkey issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB Streams</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information\n            about changes to items in a DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures\n            information about every modification to data items in the table. Whenever an application creates, updates,\n            or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record with the primary key attributes of\n            the items that were modified.

Each part is a contiguous portion\n            of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of\n            any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object\n            are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object.</p>\n<p>AWS recommends that you use multi-part uploading in the following ways:\n            1. If you're uploading large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use multi-part uploading to\n            maximize the use of your available bandwidth by uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded\n            performance.\n            2. If you're uploading over a spotty network, use multi-part uploading to increase resiliency to network\n            errors by avoiding upload restarts. When using multi-part uploading, you need to retry uploading only parts\n            that are interrupted during the upload. You don't need to restart uploading your object from the beginning.\n          </p>\n<p>In general, when your object size reaches 100 megabytes, you should consider using multipart uploads\n            instead of uploading the object in a single operation. If the file is greater than 5 gigabytes in size, you\n            must use multi-part upload to upload that file to Amazon S3.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon S3 Versioning</strong> - Amazon S3 Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of\n            an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of\n            every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended\n            user actions and application failures. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives\n            multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects. If you overwrite\n            an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. You can always restore the previous version.\n          </p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Direct Connect to provide extra bandwidth</strong> - AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service\n            solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS\n            Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or\n            colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput,\n            and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.</p>\n<p>AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the\n            AWS Direct Connect locations. This dedicated connection can be partitioned into multiple virtual interfaces.\n            This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in Amazon S3\n            using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2 instances running within an Amazon\n            Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network separation between the public\n            and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any time to meet your changing needs.\n            This is a physical connection that takes at least a month to set up.</p>\n<p><strong>Use AWS Snowball</strong> - AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need\n            to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80\n            terabytes of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 gigabytes network\n            connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.</p>\n<p>(The original AWS Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized\n            are now the primary devices used for data transfer.

You can add rules to each security group that allows traffic to or from its associated instances. You\n            can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all\n            instances that are associated with the security group.

Amazon EventBridge currently supports\n            over 15 AWS services as targets, including AWS Lambda, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, and Amazon Kinesis Streams\n            and Firehose, among others. At launch, Amazon EventBridge is has limited throughput (see Service Limits)\n            which can be increased upon request, and typical latency of around half a second.</p>\n<p>How Amazon EventBridge works:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt3-q35-i1.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/\">https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to communicate between systems and decouple the\n              architecture</strong> - As discussed above, Amazon SNS can be used for event-based services.

Network Load Balancer operates at the connection level\n            (Layer 4), routing connections to targets - Amazon EC2 instances, microservices, and containers – within\n            Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on IP protocol data. A Network Load Balancer functions at\n            the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per\n            second.</p>\n<p>Network Load Balancers expose a fixed IP to the public web, therefore allowing your application to be\n            predictably reached using this IP, while allowing you to scale your application behind the Network Load\n            Balancer using an ASG.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p>Classic Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers use the private IP addresses associated with their\n            Elastic network interfaces as the source IP address for requests forwarded to your web servers.</p>\n<p>These IP addresses can be used for various purposes, such as allowing the load balancer traffic on the web\n            servers and for request processing. It's a best practice to use security group referencing on the web\n            servers for whitelisting load balancer traffic from Classic Load Balancers or Application Load Balancers.\n          </p>\n<p>However, because Network Load Balancers don't support security groups, based on the target group\n            configurations, the IP addresses of the clients or the private IP addresses associated with the Network Load\n            Balancers must be allowed on the web server's security group.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a Classic Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling Group</strong> - Classic Load Balancer provides\n            basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates at both the request level and\n            connection level. Classic Load Balancer is intended for applications that were built within the Amazon\n            EC2-Classic network.</p>\n<p><strong>Use an Application Load Balancer with an Auto Scaling Group</strong> - Application Load Balancer\n            operates at the request level (layer 7), routing traffic to targets – Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP\n            addresses and AWS Lambda functions based on the content of the request. Ideal for advanced load balancing of\n            HTTP and HTTPS traffic, Application Load Balancer provides advanced request routing targeted at the delivery\n            of modern application architectures, including microservices and container-based applications.</p>\n<p>Application and Classic Load Balancers expose a fixed DNS (=URL) rather than the IP address. So these are\n            incorrect options for the given use-case.</p>\n<p><strong>Use an Auto Scaling Group with Dynamic Elastic IPs attachment</strong> - The option \"Use an Auto\n            Scaling Group (ASG) with Dynamic Elastic IPs attachment\" has been added as a distractor. ASG does not have a\n            dynamic Elastic IPs attachment feature.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elb-find-load-balancer-IP/\">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elb-find-load-balancer-IP/</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-internet-facing-load-balancers.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-internet-facing-load-balancers.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
