The source database\n            remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the\n            database. AWS Database Migration Service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well\n            as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to\n            Amazon Aurora.</p>\n<p>Given the use-case where the CTO at the company wants to move away from license-based, expensive, legacy\n            commercial database solutions deployed at the on-premises data center to more efficient, open-source, and\n            cost-effective options on AWS Cloud, this is an example of heterogeneous database migrations.</p>\n<p>For such a scenario, the source and target databases engines are different, like in the case of Oracle to\n            Amazon Aurora, Oracle to PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL migrations. In this case, the schema\n            structure, data types, and database code of source and target databases can be quite different, requiring a\n            schema and code transformation before the data migration starts.</p>\n<p>That makes heterogeneous migrations a two-step process. First use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert\n            the source schema and code to match that of the target database, and then use the AWS Database Migration\n            Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database. All the required data type\n            conversions will automatically be done by the AWS Database Migration Service during the migration.

It provides up to 80 TB of\n            usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of SATA SSD storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity to address\n            large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases. As each Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device can\n            handle 80TB of data, you can order 10 such devices to take care of the data transfer for all applications.\n            The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of service and AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are\n            now the primary devices used for data transfer. You may see the Snowball device on the exam, just remember\n            that the original Snowball device had 80TB of storage space. AWS Snowball Edge cannot be used for database\n            migrations.</p>\n<p><strong>AWS Glue</strong> - AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that\n            makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue job is meant to be used\n            for batch ETL data processing.

Basic Schema Copy will\n            automatically create tables and primary keys in the target instance if the target does not already contain\n            tables with the same names. Basic Schema Copy is great for doing a test migration, or when you are migrating\n            databases heterogeneously e.g. Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to Oracle. Basic Schema Copy will not migrate\n            secondary indexes, foreign keys or stored procedures.

AD Connector\n            simply connects your existing on-premises Active Directory to AWS. You cannot use it to run directory-aware\n            workloads on AWS, hence this option is not correct.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple Active Directory (Simple AD)</strong> - Simple AD provides a subset of the features offered\n            by AWS Managed Microsoft AD. Simple AD is a standalone managed directory that is powered by a Samba 4 Active\n            Directory Compatible Server. Simple AD does not support features such as trust relationships with other\n            domains.

VPC endpoints for Amazon SQS are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a highly available, scalable\n            technology that enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services.</p>\n<p>Amazon VPC endpoints are easy to configure. They also provide reliable connectivity to Amazon SQS without\n            requiring an internet gateway, Network Address Translation (NAT) instance, VPN connection, or AWS Direct\n            Connect connection.

AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to\n            connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify the network architecture.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Internet Gateway to access Amazon SQS</strong> - An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled,\n            redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and\n            the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.\n            This option is ruled out as the team does not want to use the public internet to access Amazon SQS.</p>\n<p><strong>Use VPN connection to access Amazon SQS</strong> - AWS Site-to-Site VPN (aka VPN Connection)\n            enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office site to your Amazon Virtual\n            Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). You can securely extend your data center or branch office network to the cloud\n            with an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. A VPC VPN Connection utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network\n            connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the Internet. VPN Connections can be configured in\n            minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need, have low to modest bandwidth requirements,\n            and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based connectivity. As the existing infrastructure is\n            within AWS Cloud, therefore a VPN connection is not required.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Network Address Translation (NAT) instance to access Amazon SQS</strong> - You can use a\n            network address translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private\n            subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the instances\n            from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the Internet. Amazon provides Amazon Linux AMIs that\n            are configured to run as NAT instances. These AMIs include the string amzn-ami-vpc-nat in their names, so\n            you can search for them in the Amazon EC2 console.

This enables the load\n            balancer to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy. The maximum\n            timeout value can be set between 1 and 3,600 seconds (the default is 300 seconds).

This ensures that all requests\n            from the user during the session are sent to the same instance.

But to help optimize your application’s\n            performance and security while effectively managing cost, AWS recommends that you also set up Amazon\n            CloudFront to work with your Amazon S3 bucket to serve and protect the content.</p>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content,\n            video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of Amazon\n            CloudFront can be more cost-effective than delivering it from Amazon S3 directly to your users.</p>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations. Using\n            edge servers to cache and serve content improves performance by providing content closer to where viewers\n            are located. Amazon CloudFront has edge servers in locations all around the world.</p>\n<p>When a user requests content that you serve with Amazon CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby\n            Edge Location. If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user,\n            providing a fast (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, Amazon CloudFront\n            retrieves it from your origin – for example, the S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content. Then, for the\n            next local request for the same content, it’s already cached nearby and can be served immediately.</p>\n<p>By caching your content in Edge Locations, Amazon CloudFront reduces the load on your Amazon S3 bucket and\n            helps ensure a faster response for your users when they request content. Also, data transfer out for content\n            by using CloudFront is often more cost-effective than serving files directly from Amazon S3, and there is no\n            data transfer fee from Amazon S3 to CloudFront. You only pay for what is delivered to the internet from\n            Amazon CloudFront, plus request fees.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>To reduce Amazon S3 cost, the data can be saved on an Amazon EBS volume connected to an Amazon EC2\n              instance that can host the application</strong> - Amazon EBS volumes are fast and are relatively cheap\n            (though Amazon S3 is still a cheaper alternative). But, Amazon EBS volumes are accessible only through\n            Amazon EC2 instances and are bound to a specific region.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon EFS service, as it provides a shared, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system\n              for storing AWS Cloud or on-premises data</strong> - Amazon EFS is a shareable file system that can be\n            mounted onto Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EFS is costlier than Amazon EBS and not a solution if the company\n            is looking at reducing costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Configure Amazon S3 Batch Operations to read data in bulk at one go, to reduce the number of calls\n              made to Amazon S3 buckets</strong> - This statement is incorrect and given only as a distractor.

You may use an existing CloudWatch Amazon\n            SQS metric like ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible for target tracking but you could still face an issue so\n            that the number of messages in the queue might not change proportionally to the size of the Auto Scaling\n            group that processes messages from the queue. The solution is to use a backlog per instance metric with the\n            target value being the acceptable backlog per instance to maintain.</p>\n<p>To calculate your backlog per instance, divide the ApproximateNumberOfMessages queue attribute by the\n            number of instances in the InService state for the Auto Scaling group. Then set a target value for the\n            Acceptable backlog per instance.</p>\n<p>To illustrate with an example, let's say that the current ApproximateNumberOfMessages is 1500 and the\n            fleet's running capacity is 10. If the average processing time is 0.1 seconds for each message and the\n            longest acceptable latency is 10 seconds, then the acceptable backlog per instance is 10 / 0.1, which equals\n            100. This means that 100 is the target value for your target tracking policy. If the backlog per instance is\n            currently at 150 (1500 / 10), your fleet scales out, and it scales out by five instances to maintain\n            proportion to the target value.</p>\n<p>Scaling Based on Amazon SQS:\n            <img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/sqs-as-custom-metric-diagram.png\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use a simple scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric</strong> - With simple\n            scaling, you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the Amazon CloudWatch alarms that trigger the\n            scaling process. The main issue with simple scaling is that after a scaling activity is started, the policy\n            must wait for the scaling activity or health check replacement to complete and the cooldown period to expire\n            before responding to additional alarms. This implies that the application would not be able to react quickly\n            to sudden spikes in orders.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a step scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric</strong> - With step scaling,\n            you choose scaling metrics and threshold values for the Amazon CloudWatch alarms that trigger the scaling\n            process. When step adjustments are applied, they increase or decrease the current capacity of your Auto\n            Scaling group, and the adjustments vary based on the size of the alarm breach. For the given use-case, step\n            scaling would try to approximate the correct number of instances by increasing/decreasing the steps as per\n            the policy. This is not as efficient as the target tracking policy where you can calculate the exact number\n            of instances required to handle the spike in orders.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a scheduled scaling policy based on a custom Amazon SQS queue metric</strong> - Scheduled\n            scaling allows you to set your scaling schedule. For example, let's say that every week the traffic to your\n            web application starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday.\n            You can plan your scaling actions based on the predictable traffic patterns of your web application. Scaling\n            actions are performed automatically as a function of time and date. You cannot use scheduled scaling\n            policies to address the sudden spike in orders.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-using-sqs-queue.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"

Amazon SQS eliminates the\n            complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers\n            developers to focus on differentiating work. Using Amazon SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages\n            between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be\n            available.</p>\n<p>Amazon SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort\n            ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed\n            exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.</p>\n<p>By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300 messages per\n            second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second) without batching. Therefore, using batching you\n            can meet a throughput requirement of upto 3,000 messages per second.</p>\n<p>The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix. The suffix counts towards the 80-character queue\n            name limit. To determine whether a queue is FIFO, you can check whether the queue name ends with the suffix.\n          </p>\n<p>If you have an existing application that uses standard queues and you want to take advantage of the\n            ordering or exactly-once processing features of FIFO queues, you need to configure the queue and your\n            application correctly. You can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue.

First,\n            you don’t need to plan for and allocate a specific amount of storage space because Amazon S3 buckets scale\n            automatically. As Amazon S3 is a serverless service, you don’t need to manage or patch servers that store\n            files yourself; you just put and get your content. Finally, even if you require a server for your\n            application (for example, because you have a dynamic application), the server can be smaller because it\n            doesn’t have to handle requests for static content.</p>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content,\n            video streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of Amazon\n            CloudFront can be more cost-effective than delivering it from Amazon S3 directly to your users. Amazon\n            CloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations. Using edge\n            servers to cache and serve content improves performance by providing content closer to where viewers are\n            located.</p>\n<p>When a user requests content that you serve with Amazon CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby\n            Edge Location. If Amazon CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the\n            user, providing a fast (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront\n            retrieves it from your origin – for example, the Amazon S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content. Then,\n            for the next local request for the same content, it’s already cached nearby and can be served immediately.\n          </p>\n<p>By caching your content in Edge Locations, Amazon CloudFront reduces the load on your Amazon S3 bucket and\n            helps ensure a faster response for your users when they request content. Also, data transfer out for content\n            by using Amazon CloudFront is often more cost-effective than serving files directly from Amazon S3, and\n            there is no data transfer fee from Amazon S3 to Amazon CloudFront. You only pay for what is delivered to the\n            internet from Amazon CloudFront, plus request fees.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Configure AWS Lambda with an Amazon RDS database to provide a serverless architecture</strong> -\n            Amazon RDS is not the right choice for the current scenario because of the overhead of a database management\n            system, as the given use-case can be addressed by using Amazon S3 storage solution.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon CloudFront with Amazon DynamoDB for greater speed and low latency access to static\n              assets</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit\n            millisecond performance at any scale.

AWS Global Accelerator is easy to set up, configure,\n            and manage. It provides static IP addresses that provide a fixed entry point to your applications and\n            eliminate the complexity of managing specific IP addresses for different AWS Regions and Availability Zones\n            (AZs). AWS Global Accelerator always routes user traffic to the optimal endpoint based on performance,\n            reacting instantly to changes in application health, your user’s location, and policies that you configure.\n            Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP.\n            Therefore, this option is correct.</p>\n<p>How AWS Global Accelerator Works:\n            <img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/r2018/b/ubiquity/global-accelerator-how-it-works.feb297eb78d8cc55205874a1691e0ea2bc8bdbf1.png\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/\">https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon CloudFront to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results</strong> -\n            Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos,\n            applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a\n            developer-friendly environment.</p>\n<p>Amazon CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure that popular content can be served\n            quickly to your viewers. Amazon CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring more of your content\n            closer to your viewers, even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP, to help improve\n            performance for that content. Regional edge caches help with all types of content, particularly content that\n            tends to become less popular over time. Examples include user-generated content, such as video, photos, or\n            artwork; e-commerce assets such as product photos and videos; and news and event-related content that might\n            suddenly find new popularity.

Elastic Load Balancer cannot help with decreasing latency of incoming traffic from the\n            source.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Auto Scaling group to provide a low latency way to distribute live sports results</strong> -\n            Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available\n            to handle the load for your application. You create collections of Amazon EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling\n            groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto\n            Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. Auto Scaling group cannot help with decreasing\n            latency of incoming traffic from the source.</p>\n<p>Exam Alert:</p>\n<p>Please note the differences between the capabilities of AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront -</p>\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its\n            edge locations around the world. Amazon CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as\n            images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). AWS Global\n            Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the\n            edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.</p>\n<p>AWS Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice\n            over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast\n            regional failover.

It enhances the performance\n            of inter-instance communication that is critical for scaling HPC and machine learning applications. EFA\n            devices provide all Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) devices functionalities plus a new OS bypass hardware\n            interface that allows user-space applications to communicate directly with the hardware-provided reliable\n            transport functionality.</p>\n<p>How Elastic Fabric Adapter Works:\n            <img src=\"https://d1.awsstatic.com/Product-Page-Diagram_Elastic-Fabric-Adapter_How-it-Works_updated.2a51303e17a203eb094ab098ebc31a61dab66365.png\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/\">https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Elastic Network Interface (ENI)</strong> - An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a logical\n            networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.

The ENI is the\n            simplest networking component available on AWS and is insufficient for HPC workflows.</p>\n<p><strong>Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)</strong> - Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) devices support enhanced\n            networking via single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities.\n            Although enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and\n            consistently lower inter-instance latencies, still EFA is a better fit for the given use-case because the\n            EFA device provides all the functionality of an ENA device, plus hardware support for applications to\n            communicate directly with the EFA device without involving the instance kernel (OS-bypass communication)\n            using an extended programming interface.</p>\n<p><strong>Elastic IP Address (EIP)</strong> - An Elastic IP address (EIP) is a static IPv4 address associated\n            with your AWS account. An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the internet.\n            It is not a networking device that can be used to facilitate HPC workflows.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/efa.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/\">https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/efa/</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>"

For example, if a test script writes\n            accidentally to a production DynamoDB table or someone mistakenly issues a \"DeleteItem\" call, PITR has you\n            covered.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB on-demand backup to restore the table to the state just before corrupted data\n              was written</strong> - The on-demand backup and restore process scales without degrading the performance\n            or availability of your applications. It uses a new and unique distributed technology that lets you complete\n            backups in seconds regardless of table size. You can create backups that are consistent within seconds\n            across thousands of partitions without worrying about schedules or long-running backup processes. All\n            on-demand backups are cataloged, discoverable, and retained until they are explicitly deleted.</p>\n<p>On-demand backup is created upon request. So this option is not correct since an on-demand backup cannot be\n            created pre-emptively to handle data corruption issues that happen once in a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Configure the Amazon DynamoDB table as a global table and point the application to use the table\n              from another AWS region that has no corrupted data</strong> - Global tables build on the global Amazon\n            DynamoDB footprint to provide you with a fully managed, multi-Region, and multi-active database that\n            delivers fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications.</p>\n<p>Global tables eliminate the difficult work of replicating data between Regions and resolving update\n            conflicts, enabling you to focus on your application's business logic. In addition, global tables enable\n            your applications to stay highly available even in the unlikely event of isolation or degradation of an\n            entire Region.</p>\n<p>Any changes made to any item in any replica table are replicated to all the other replicas within the same\n            global table. In a global table, a newly written item is usually propagated to all replica tables within a\n            second. With a global table, each replica table stores the same set of data items. Amazon DynamoDB does not\n            support partial replication of only some of the items. If applications update the same item in different\n            Regions at about the same time, conflicts can arise. To help ensure eventual consistency, Amazon DynamoDB\n            global tables use a last-writer-wins reconciliation between concurrent updates, in which DynamoDB makes its\n            best effort to determine the last writer. With this conflict resolution mechanism, all replicas agree on the\n            latest update and converge toward a state in which they all have identical data.</p>\n<p>Global tables replicate your Amazon DynamoDB tables automatically across your choice of AWS Regions. This\n            option has been added as a distractor since you cannot point the application to use the table from another\n            AWS region, since there is no \"other\" table in another region. It's just a single logical Global table.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon DynamoDB Streams to restore the table to the state just before corrupted data was\n              written</strong> - Amazon DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in\n            any Amazon DynamoDB table and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours. Applications can access\n            this log and view the data items as they appeared before and after they were modified, in near-real time. A\n            DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a Amazon DynamoDB table. When\n            you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the\n            table.</p>\n<p>Amazon DynamoDB Streams writes stream records in near-real time so that you can build applications that\n            consume these streams and take action based on the contents. It will take considerable effort and custom\n            coding to reliably rebuild table data to the state just before any corrupted data was written.

For example, your application runs on a\n            t2.micro. Scaling up that application vertically means running it on a larger instance such as t2.large.\n            Scaling down that application vertically means running it on a smaller instance such as t2.nano. Scalability\n            is very common for non-distributed systems, such as a database. There’s usually a limit to how much you can\n            vertically scale (hardware limit).\n            In this case, as the instance type was upgraded from t2.nano to u-12tb1.metal, this is a scale up example of\n            vertical scalability.</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>This is a scale up example of horizontal scalability</strong> - Horizontal Scalability means\n            increasing the number of instances/systems for your application. When you increase the number of instances,\n            it's called scale out whereas if you decrease the number of instances, it's called scale-in. Scale up is\n            used in conjunction with vertical scaling and not with horizontal scaling. Hence this is incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>This is a scale out example of vertical scalability</strong> - Scale out is used in conjunction\n            with horizontal scaling and not with vertical scaling. Hence this is incorrect.</p>\n<p><strong>This is an example of high availability</strong> - High availability means running your\n            application/system in at least 2 data centers (== Availability Zones). The goal of high availability is to\n            survive a data center loss. An example of High Availability is when you run instances for the same\n            application across multi AZ.

If you have\n            objects that are smaller than 1GB or if the data set is less than 1GB in size, you should consider using\n            Amazon CloudFront's PUT/POST commands for optimal performance. The given use case has data larger than 1GB\n            and hence S3 Transfer Acceleration is a better option.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt4-q37-i1.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Use Amazon EC2 with AWS Global Accelerator for faster distribution of content, while using Amazon\n              S3 as storage service</strong>- AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that sends your user’s\n            traffic through Amazon Web Service’s global network infrastructure, improving your internet user performance\n            by up to 60%.

By using an Aurora global database, you can plan for and recover from disaster\n            fairly quickly. Recovery from disaster is typically measured using values for RTO and RPO.</p>\n<p>Recovery time objective (RTO) – The time it takes a system to return to a working state after a disaster.\n            In other words, RTO measures downtime. For an Aurora global database, RTO can be in the order of minutes.\n          </p>\n<p>Recovery point objective (RPO) – The amount of data that can be lost (measured in time). For an Aurora\n            global database, RPO is typically measured in seconds.</p>\n<p>With an Aurora global database, you can choose from two different approaches to failover:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Managed planned failover – This feature is intended for controlled environments, such as disaster\n                recovery (DR) testing scenarios, operational maintenance, and other planned operational procedures.\n                Managed planned failover allows you to relocate the primary DB cluster of your Aurora global database to\n                one of the secondary Regions. Because this feature synchronizes secondary DB clusters with the primary\n                before making any other changes, RPO is 0 (no data loss).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unplanned failover (\"detach and promote\") – To recover from an unplanned outage, you can perform a\n                cross-Region failover to one of the secondaries in your Aurora global database. The RTO for this manual\n                process depends on how quickly you can perform the tasks listed in Recovering an Amazon Aurora global\n                database from an unplanned outage. The RPO is typically measured in seconds, but this depends on the\n                Aurora storage replication lag across the network at the time of the failure.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Disaster Recovery in Aurora Global Databases:\n            <img src=\"https://assets-pt.media.datacumulus.com/aws-saa-pt/assets/pt4-q61-i1.jpg\"/>\n            via - <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>Incorrect options:</p>\n<p><strong>Provision Amazon RDS for MySQL with a cross-Region read replica</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Provision Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with a cross-Region read replica</strong></p>\n<p>Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database (DB) instances. They\n            make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy\n            database workloads. For a failover, read replicas have to be manually promoted to a standalone database\n            instance since the process is not automatic. Hence, the RTO will be quite high, so both these options are\n            not correct for this use case.</p>\n<p><strong>Provision Amazon DynamoDB global tables</strong> - Aurora Global Database is good for applications\n            that need to support cross-Region reads with low latency updates and the ability to quickly failover between\n            regions. DynamoDB global tables provide cross-region active-active capabilities with high performance, but\n            you lose some of the data access flexibility that comes with SQL-based databases. Due to the active-active\n            configuration of DynamoDB global tables, there is no concept of failover because the application writes to\n            the table in its region, and then the data is replicated to keep the other regions' table in sync. DynamoDB\n            global tables is a much costlier solution than Aurora Global Database for the given requirement.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-failover\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-failover</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/how-to-use-amazon-dynamodb-global-tables-to-power-multiregion-architectures/\">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/how-to-use-amazon-dynamodb-global-tables-to-power-multiregion-architectures/</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/\">https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html</a>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database.html</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n</div>"
